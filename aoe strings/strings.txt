70034,"Human populations around the world expanded following the end of the last Ice Age and gradually settled in the locations where food was plentiful. Once the better spots were taken, competition began over who would hold these locations. A good site might mean the difference between survival or death during a drought.\n\nGeographic features took on special meaning to those groups settled permanently in an area. Waterfalls or interestingly shaped rock faces, for example, might have special properties associated with them. Ownership of these features was a source of pride for the group. Loss of control to neighbors might have been a blow to the unity or strength of the group.\n\nPrehistoric peoples had an affinity for the natural world that is not found in sedentary cultures. Awareness of what was going on around them was critical to the survival of a family group or tribe.

The more villagers you have chopping wood and the more boats you have fishing for food, the faster your stockpile grows.\n5. Don't forget to build Houses to support the new villagers and boats you create."

70044,"The increase in human population and the competition for good food sites accelerated the advance in technology that had been fostered by the challenging environments of the last Ice Age. Better and more varied tools increased the efficiency of hunters and gatherers, increasing the advantages of humans over other varieties of life.\n\nAnthropologists mark the technological advance of our human ancestors by dividing their progress into eras defined by the artifacts that have survived over the years. Most of these artifacts are tools, and the oldest of these are made of stone. Later, tools slowly started being made of various metals, such as copper and bronze. The most commonly used names for these eras are the Old Stone Age (Paleolithic), New Stone Age (Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Era Êelaza. In Age of Empires, you advance from the Stone Age to the Tool Age to the Bronze Age to the Era Êelaza. Each advance requires that some prerequisites be met. Entering a new age makes it possible to research new technologies and to build new buildings and units.\n\nThe Tool Age represents innovation from the large, bulky choppers and hand axes first used as tools. The new stone tools were blades struck from a core stone. These small blades, called microliths, were fitted into handles as knives and onto shafts as arrow and spearpoints. These tools were much more efficient than their predecessors and made daily tasks much easier."

70054,"Archaeological evidence suggests that warfare has been part of human life for much longer than we would like to admit. Previous theories assumed that the early nomads were more peaceful than their sedentary counterparts in later years, but mass burial sites found across the world have made scientists review that theory. A mass burial in Jebel Sahaba, south of Egypt, for example, contains the remains of 61 adults and children. Some of the skeletons show evidence of hard blows or arrow points embedded in bones. This site has been dated to about 13,000 years ago. The implication of evidence such as this is that prehistoric life was a struggle against other humans, not just nature or the elements. People who possessed good hunting and foraging lands had to defend them with force or risk annihilation."

The great Pharaoh Narmer seeks to unite the Upper and Lower Kingdoms into a unified Egypt. Using the wealth brought from farming along the Nile's banks, he will finally be able to defeat his rivals. Take control of the villages along the river and build a surplus of 800 food to feed your people and Narmer's warriors. In addition, take control of the ancient stone circle of Nabta Playa, found in the desert to the west. Controlling this ancient Ruin will demonstrate Narmer's power to his opponents. Be wary of nearby peoples, however. You need not destroy them but know that they will attempt to undermine Narmer's goal of uniting Egypt.\n\nFARMING\nBefore you can build Farms, you must construct a Targowisko. To farm, click a villager, and then right-click a Farma. The villager gathers food and deposits it at the Centrum miasta or Spichlerz (whichever is closer), where it is added to your stockpile (as shown in the upper-left corner of the game screen). Farms produce food at a fixed rate, so assigning more than one villager to work a Farma does not increase its productivity. Researching Udomowienie, the Pîug, and Nawadnianie (at the Targowisko) does increase Farma productivity. Farms eventually go fallow (exhaust their capacity to grow food) and need to be rebuilt.\n\nUPGRADING UNITS\nTo upgrade your military units (Clubmen), click the Koszary, and then click the Upgrade to Battle Axe button. Your existing Clubmen are upgraded to Axemen (which are more powerful) and you can no longer build Clubmen, just Axemen.\n\nRESEARCHING TECHNOLOGY\nYou can research new technologies as your civilization enters each new age. Refer to the Technology Tree for information about the technologies you can research in each age. To be successful, you must advance to keep up with, or surpass, your rivals economically and militarily. Researching technology takes time and costs resources, but after you have researched a technology, your civilization immediately begins reaping its benefit(s).\nTo research technology, click a technology building on the game map (the technologies you can research appear on the buttons at the bottom of the game screen), then click the button that corresponds to the technology you want to research. For example, to research Obróbka narzỳdzi from the Ziemianka, click the Odkryj Obróbka narzỳdzi button.\n\nCONTROLLING RUINS\nRuins are ancient structures resembling Stonehenge that were built by now-lost cultures and bring prestige to the civilization that controls them.

70064,"Every year, heavy monsoon rains in the mountains of Ethiopia would cause the Nile to flood its banks downstream in Egypt. This period of flooding from June to September was called Akhet. While waiting for the waters to recede and reveal the fertile mud and fresh silt left behind, Egyptian farmers spent their time mending and making tools and looking after their animals. As Egypt became a kingdom, the farmers would use some of this time to work for the king, called the pharaoh, to build tombs and temples.\n\nWhen the waters receded, the Egyptians would plow the soil during a season called Peret from October to February. Egyptians plowed by hand or used animal-pulled plows. Seeds were sown, and goats and other animals walked over the fields to push the seeds into the ground and provide additional fertilizer. The Egyptians grew a variety of crops, including wheat, barley, flax, onions, leeks, garlic, beans, lettuce, lentils, cabbages, radishes, turnips, grapes, figs, plums, and melons.\n\nHarvest time was a period called Shemu, from March to May. Grain was cut with sickles, tied into bundles, and carried away to granaries. Skilled artisans in the town turned the wheat into bread, the barley into beer, and the flax into linen cloth. Papyrus reeds were gathered to make sandals, boats, baskets, mats, and paper. Agriculture allowed professions to develop and fostered new cultural tools and artifacts.\n\nAlthough the first signs of agriculture date from 8000 BCE, the first farming communities did not appear in Egypt until the period from circa 6000 to 3150 BCE. These early settlements introduced new technologies such as irrigation in the form of canals and basins. This allowed the Egyptians to regulate the floods to maximize food production. The Egyptian agricultural system allowed the region to support between 2 to 12 million people. Even as late as the Roman era, Egypt was still considered the granary of the ancient world.\n\nThe population boom brought about by agriculture caused villages to coalesce into small kingdoms along the Nile. These kingdoms invaded and annexed others until only two kingdoms remained, those of Upper and Lower Egypt in the south and north, respectively. This terminology derives from the flow of the Nile River from the highlands of Eastern Africa in the south to the Nile Delta in the north. The king of Upper Egypt wore a tall white crown, called the Hedjet, while the king of Lower Egypt wore a red crown called the Deshret. Around 3100 BCE, a king named Narmer—also identified as Menes—unified the two kingdoms. A siltstone tablet called the Palette of Narmer depicts the king wearing the crown of Upper Egypt on one side and the crown of Lower Egypt on the other. A later pharaoh named Djet would be depicted wearing both crowns together at once, the double crown known as the Pschent, which symbolized the unity of Egypt."

70070,"Mediterranean, around 2700 BCE\n\nCele: Stockpile 500 stone and 500 gold.\n\n• Villagers deposit stone and gold at the Centrum miasta\n• Assign multiple villagers to mines to increase production\n• Establish trade routes with foreign Docks using Trade Boats or Statek handlowys\n\nThe reputation of a united Egypt is spreading to all corners of the world and trade has vastly increased your people's wealth. With this prosperity, the Pharaoh Djoser has decided that a mere mastaba, a simple mud tomb, will not be enough to serve him in the afterlife. Instead, he has ordered the architect Imhotep to design a stepped pyramid that will be visible from miles away. Such a large project will require great resources. You have been ordered to go to the north and set up a trade post to collect the gold for the pyramid. At the same time, you must venture into the desert and find a quarry to supply stone for the construction. Your trading partners, the Minoans, Canaanites, and Libijczycy, could become jealous of Egypt's success and might even cease trade and attack your people. In case our diplomats fail to keep the peace, you must defend your trade ships. The pharaoh is entrusting you with the success of this project.\n\nMINING STONE AND GOLD\nTo mine stone or gold, click a villager, and then right-click a stone mine or a gold mine. The villager gathers the stone or gold and deposits it at the Centrum miasta, where it is added to your stockpile (as shown in the upper-left corner of the game screen). The more villagers you assign to mine, the faster your stockpile grows.\n\nTRADING WITH OTHER CIVILIZATIONS\nTrading lets you exchange the food, wood, and stone in your stockpile for gold. You trade with other civilizations by establishing trade routes to and from foreign Docks. Trade Boats and Statek handlowys travel to foreign Docks with a cargo of trade goods (20 food, wood, or stone), receive trade goods for gold, and return to your Port to deposit the gold. The farther you travel to the foreign Port, the more valuable your cargo and the more gold you receive. Trade vessels can carry a maximum of 20 trade goods. If the stockpile of resources you are trading drops to zero, the trade vessel becomes idle. Trading has no effect on the player you are trading with. The resources you drop off and the gold you receive are not added to or deducted from the other civilization's stockpile. To trade with another civilization, build a Ýódè handlowa or Statek handlowy (at the Port). Click the Ýódè handlowa or Statek handlowy, click the button at the bottom of the game screen that corresponds to the resource you want the vessel to carry (food, wood, or stone), and then right-click the Port with which you wish to trade. To display a vessel's cargo, click a Ýódè handlowa or Statek handlowy. The cargo it carries is displayed in the status box at the bottom of the game screen. To display the gold earned from trading at a Port, click the Port. The amount of gold that you receive for your trade goods is displayed in the status box at the bottom of the game screen (shown as the amount of gold/cost).\n\nTo display the objectives while you are playing the game, click the Objectives button in the upper-right corner of the game screen.

70072,"With the supplies you gathered, the first pyramid of Egypt is built in honor of Pharaoh Djoser. People from far and wide are in awe of this achievement and Egypt's fame grows. Djoser's successor already has plans to build an even larger pyramid. In time, these structures will dot the land of Egypt and last an eternity, guiding the pharaohs into the next life."
70073,"The pharaoh has died and the pyramid is still not finished. Djoser has instead been buried in a simple mastaba intended for a lesser family member. If you ever make it to the afterlife, Djoser will be waiting with the proper punishment for your failure."
70074,"In prehistory, people bartered with other groups for food and useful necessities. Later, when small farming communities appeared in Egypt, trade increased in importance and people traveled far to acquire rare goods or tools that they could not find in their home towns. Evidence of trade between Egypt, Mesopotamia, and even the Indus Valley of India has been dated to as early as 3000 BCE. During Pharaoh Narmer's reign, pottery with Narmer's inscription was produced in Canaan, in the modern-day Levant, for shipment to Egypt, showing that Egyptian rulers looked overseas for rare luxury items. Despite these early contacts, trade did not become a major source of wealth for Egyptians until the late Old Kingdom. Trade provided Egypt with cedar wood from Lebanon; ebony and ivory from Africa; incense, myrrh, and oils from Arabia; gems from Afghanistan; and gold from Nubia. In return for these goods, Egypt exported grain, flax, papyrus, linen, gold vessels, and fish.\n\nThe Nile River was as instrumental to Egyptian trade as it was to the country's agriculture. The Egyptians constructed rafts and boats from papyrus reeds, as quality wood was rare in Egypt. The wooden boats that were produced were long and were lashed together with ropes. The seams between planks were packed with bundles of reed to keep the water out and they lacked the internal framing that later boats had. Egyptians used these boats to transport goods along the Nile and the Mediterranean coast.\n\nTrade and farming generated wealth for the pharaoh, around whom a cult was established, linking him to the god Horus. Massive tombs were built to prepare and house the pharaoh for the afterlife. These tombs were filled with gifts, animals, ships, and even servants. The early tombs were called mastabas, rectangular mud tombs. Between c. 2667 to c. 2648 BCE, Pharaoh Djoser built the first pyramid, consisting of six mastabas on top of each other. Each successive mastaba was smaller than the one below it, giving the appearance of a stepped structure. An architect named Imhotep is traditionally credited with this design. The biggest pyramids ever built were those at Giza. The largest was that of Khofu, also known as Cheops, and dates from between c. 2560 to c. 2540 BCE. During the Middle Kingdom, fewer pyramids were built and they were of a smaller scale. By the New Kingdom, the tradition of pyramid building had largely ended, although the Nubians of modern-day Sudan continued to build pyramids for centuries."

70080,"Heliopolis, around 2500 BCE\n\nCele: Capture (convert) the Miotacz kamieni and bring it to your Centrum miasta.\n\n• Use Priests to convert enemy units\n• Odkryj at the Âwiçtynia for upgrades to Priests\n• Mine gold to replace killed Priests\n\nEgyptian culture is flourishing and the population is growing. In order to provide for the administration of the kingdom and serve the gods, new professions have been established. Scribes and priests help the pharaoh in his dealings with the military, the people, and the gods. These new specialists have quickly gained prominence and become vital to Egyptian civilization.\n\nIn the north, west of the Nile Delta, scouts report Libyan raiding parties are approaching one of Egypt's most sacred cities, Heliopolis, built to honor the Sun God Ra. As the lector priest of the city's main temple and army scribe of the pharaoh, you are commanded to stop these raiders at all costs. The priests in the city have offered their services to support the army. However, you must be wary of the Libijczycy who bring a siege engine with them to demolish the city's walls. This machine could be useful for our own armies, so instead of destroying it, the pharaoh has ordered you to capture this Miotacz kamieni and bring it to the Centrum miasta at Heliopolis.\n\nCONVERTING ENEMY UNITS\nTo convert an enemy unit, click a Kapîan, and then right-click the unit to convert. Or click the Convert button, and then click the enemy unit to convert. The unit is converted to the Kapîan's civilization. Researching Êycie pozagrobowe (at the Âwiçtynia) increases the range of Priests for converting military units. Researching Monoteizm (at the Âwiçtynia) lets Priests convert buildings and enemy Priests. To convert buildings, the Kapîan must move adjacent to the building. Boats are twice as resistant to conversion as other units. Rydwans are also resistant to conversion. Researching Astrologia (at the Âwiçtynia) lets Priests convert units more quickly. Priests must rejuvenate their strength after attempting a conversion. The faith percentage is shown in the status box at the bottom of the game screen. Researching Fanatyzm allows Priests to recover their faith more quickly. Priests do not automatically convert nearby units, unless they are attacked. When the Kapîan has converted a unit, he stands idle until given another command. If a Kapîan converts a Ýódè transportowa or Statek transportowy carrying units, the ship is converted but its cargo is not. Converted units maintain their attributes (attack, range, etc.) at conversion; they cannot be upgraded. Technologies you research do not apply to converted units, except Monoteizm, Astrologia, Fanatyzm, Balistyka, and Sztuka oblỳênicza. Priests cannot convert Centrum miasta, Wonders, or allied villagers, military units, or buildings.\n\nCOUNTER UNITS\nIn this game, every unit has its weaknesses and counters that prevent it from dominating a match. A good example of this in the Tool Age is the Ýucznik. This Tool Age ranged unit is quite cheap and can easily hit-and-run enemy units, making it a very difficult unit to beat when in large numbers. A good answer to a high number of Bowmen are Slingers. Slingers can be built at the Koszary, costing food and stone. Aside from strong pierce armor, the Slingers also have a hidden attack bonus against all ranged units, making them the perfect counter for large numbers of Bowmen.\n\nTo display the objectives while you are playing the game, click the Objectives button in the upper-right corner of the game screen.

One possible strategy is to use your resources to build a large force to destroy all units guarding the Miotacz kamieni before your Kapîan converts it. Another option is to approach more slowly and use your Kapîan to convert the supporting enemy units one by one before converting the Miotacz kamieni.\n3. If your original Kapîan is killed, you can mine the deposits of gold in the area to create additional Priests.\n4. The enemy has many Bowmen. It is a good idea to train several Slingers to protect your Priests, since Slingers are strong against other ranged units such as the Ýucznik."
70082,"You have saved Heliopolis from the Libyan marauders, and the gods are pleased. The pharaoh is grateful and has promised to fund the creation of a statue resembling your visage. It is an honor not usually bestowed upon someone other than the pharaoh himself."
70083,"The sacred city of Heliopolis and its mighty temples have been plundered by the Libyan raiders. In anger, the pharaoh has stripped you of your titles and forces you to help work on his monument for the afterlife. In case you have forgotten, the builders are buried in the tomb with the pharaoh when he dies. It appears that you will have all of eternity to make up for your mistakes."
70084,"The Egyptians developed a rich and varied religion based on the worship of around 2000 gods and goddesses. Some of these deities were worshiped throughout the country, some by a specific town, and others within the home. Many of their religious beliefs were linked to the sun and the Nile—the two entities most responsible for the agricultural bounty that was the basis for Egypt's relative affluence. The pharaohs, with the help of priests, conducted rites throughout the year to ensure the regular flood of the Nile and movements of the sun.\n\nFor major deities, great temples were built. A temple was not a place of worship, rather it was considered a home on earth for the god or goddess to which it was associated. The cult statue representing the deity might only be shown a few times each year at special festivals. Offerings brought to the temple were collected by priests and priestesses. The people would pray to a statue of the pharaoh because it was believed to possess divine powers and might intercede on behalf of the petitioner. Questions for the god or goddess were passed to priests or priestesses for reply.\n\nOne of the most unique religious events in Egyptian history happened during the New Kingdom. Amenhotep IV—presumably the father of the famous Tutankhamun—created a cult around Aten, the sun god. Amenhotep IV renamed himself Akhenaten, in honor of the god, and while he still acknowledged the existence of other gods, he only worshiped Aten. This created a quasi-monotheistic religion. The impact of this new cult was very limited and, after his death, it disappeared as quickly as it had appeared.\n\nThe decline of the Old Kingdom happened during the sixth dynasty (2345-2181 BCE) when the power of the pharaoh gradually weakened in favor of regional governors. Internal disorders and a serious drought, combined with unusually low Nile floods, were the final blows to a decaying kingdom. The Old Kingdom period was followed by the First Intermediate Period, during which Egypt was divided for over a century."

70090,"The Fourth Cataract, 1878-1860 BCE\n\nCele: Find the island and build on it.\n\n• Locate the island on the Nile River\n• Build a Centrum miasta on the island\n• Build two Sentry Towers on the island\n\nFor centuries, the Nubians of the South have attacked and pillaged our cities in Upper Egypt. Pharaoh Senusret III is determined to deal with them for good. His plan is to subdue lower Nubia by building forts along the Nile River all the way to the Fourth Cataract. To the south of your position, there is an island on the Nile which would be an ideal location for such a fort. Explore the island, clear it of enemies, and build a Centrum miasta and two Sentry Towers there. But remember to be wary of Nubian raiders coming down the river.\n\nTRANSPORTING UNITS ACROSS WATER\nVillagers, military units, and Artifacts can be loaded aboard a transport vessel and moved across water. Allied units can also be transported.

In order to be able to build a second Centrum miasta, you must be in the Bronze Age and have a Centrum rzçdowe.\n4. You will need to build a transport to carry villagers to the island to build the Centrum miasta. You should take several villagers because the island is inhabited by hungry lions and crocodiles, which will attack your villagers on sight.\n5. When the island is free from predators, you can build a Centrum miasta and begin gathering the stone you need to build two Sentry Towers."
70092,"Risking their lives, your builders managed to construct the fort on the Nile River island. It is only one of many forts, but it is certainly the most important as it controls access to the river itself. Your stalwart soldiers man the fortifications, and thus the Nubians have given up on their attempts to raid Egypt. You do not believe the Nubians will be stopped permanently, but your actions have brought peace for the time being."
70093,"Attacking by night, the hostile Nubians managed to pick off your builders one by one, dooming your fort's construction. Because of the sizable gap you have allowed to appear in the Egyptian defenses, the Nubians are now able to raid Egypt at will. The pharaoh is sending you on a solo scouting mission into Nubian lands without food, water or weapons. Pray to Ra that your end is swift, and that Osiris’ judgement is lenient."
70094,"Following the First Intermediate Period, prince Mentuhotep II (c. 2061 – 2010 BCE) of the 11th dynasty built on the successes of his predecessors and re-united Egypt by defeating the rulers of Herakleopolis in Lower Egypt. This ushered in a new period in Egyptian history called the Middle Kingdom. Mentuhotep II made Thebes the capital of the kingdom and is sometimes referred to as the \"second Menes\", in remembrance of the first ruler of the Old Kingdom, identified with Narmer, who united Egypt centuries before. Egyptian society had changed drastically since the Old Kingdom, despite the attempts by Middle Kingdom pharaohs to emulate their predecessors from the previous era. Local officials had much more power and wealth, and it had become easier for them to rise in rank. These differences are apparent in Egyptian art of the period. Pharaohs were no longer the only ones commissioning art, as local rulers and the upper class could do so as well, resulting in greater variety and diversity of artwork.\n\nConflict with Egypt's southern neighbors, the Nubians, was very common in this period, but it was not until the reign of Senusret III (c. 1878 – 1860 BCE) that Egypt made significant conquests in the south. Senusret III led four military expeditions against the Nubians and managed to bring lower Nubia, in the north of the region, under Egyptian control. To consolidate these conquests, the pharaoh ordered his subordinates to build a network of fortifications along the border to block further raids by Nubians.\n\nSenusret III is also known to have led a military expedition into Canaan, but his main achievement was in bringing stability and prosperity to Egypt. During his reign, the cults of Osiris and Amun became increasingly popular and Osiris would become a very important god of the afterlife, where he served as ruler and judge. Senusret III also finished the construction of Amun's Âwiçtynia near Karnak begun by Mentuhotep II. This temple was the largest religious building ever constructed at its time. The reigns of Senusret III and the other kings of the 12th dynasty are considered to be a golden age for Egypt."

70104,"Amenemhat IV (c.1815 – 1807 BCE) stepped in the footsteps of his father, Amenemhat III, and his grandfather, Senusret III. He finished his father's building projects and launched several military and trade expeditions to secure Egyptian interests within her sphere of influence. Trade was thriving, especially with the cities in the Levant, such as Byblos in modern Lebanon. Amenemhat IV died without a male heir so his sister, Sobekneferu, became the first woman to rule Egypt. Only two years after her succession, she died suddenly without an heir, ending the 12th dynasty.\n\nThe 13th dynasty was considerably weaker than its predecessor and Egypt descended into a gradual decline. Its rulers, unable to control the whole country, allowed Libyan raiders and migrating semi-nomadic peoples from the northeast to move freely into Lower Egypt. Of these peoples, the Hyksos were the most dangerous. They started to replace local rulers, creating their own state within Egypt's borders. This period is described as the Second Intermediate Period by historians, and lasted until the eviction of the Hyksos many centuries later.\n\nEgyptians were early innovators in boat building because of the importance of the Nile for transporting goods, and the role of trade in the Eastern Mediterranean. Naval battles were comparatively rare in Egyptian history, however, as the Egyptians did not have ambitions to become a maritime power during this period. Nevertheless, Egypt fought in two notable sea battles for the defense of the kingdom. The first was the siege of the Hyksos capital of Avaris between c. 1570 and c. 1544 BCE when the Egyptians used boats to take control of the canals around the city. The second battle was much later, during the reign of Ramesses III, who fought a naval battle against pirates and raiders of the Sea Peoples at the Battle of the Delta (c. 1175 BCE). Ramesses won the battle and Egypt was one of the few civilizations to survive the initial decades of the Bronze Age Collapse, when migrating peoples destroyed most of the established Near Eastern civilizations.\n\nSea warfare of this era revolved primarily around hand-to-hand fighting. Ships closed with each other and soldiers boarded enemy ships or engaged in missile fire. Ships needed to be fast to catch enemies, but also had to carry a contingent of troops for boarding. Successful battles depended on bringing overwhelming strength to bear on isolated parts of the enemy fleet."

The pharaohs have driven out the foreign invaders and secured Egypt's borders. The reigning pharaoh, Queen Hatszepsut , promises to be one of the greatest rulers of this land. She has already extended the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor, but her ambition knows no bounds. She plans to construct an even larger temple called Djeser-Djeseru, the \"holy of holies,\" and has given you the opportunity to oversee its construction.

After successfully besieging the Hyksos at their capital of Avaris, Ahmose I expanded Egypt's borders to defend against further invasions. Even though Lower Egypt was occupied by the Hyksos for a long time, the Egyptians benefited from this occupation. New technologies, such as chariots, improved bronze working, and advanced weaponry, were introduced. The Egyptians also began to appreciate the need to expand beyond Egypt to protect the borders of the Egyptian homelands. The period initiated by Ahmose I's reign is called the New Kingdom by historians. During this era, Egypt became one of the great powers of the ancient Middle East.\n\nIt was during this era that the pharaohs were first called ‘pharaoh’, a term which derives from the name for the ruler's palace. Pharaohs were usually male, but a few women ruled Egypt, although they were depicted with male attributes in Egyptian art. One woman pharaoh was Hatszepsut , one of the most successful rulers of Egypt. Hatszepsut  constructed many of Egypt's great monuments, such as impressive temples and obelisks at Luxor and the temple complex at Karnak. Her most prestigious project, however, was the Djeser-Djeseru, the \"holy of holies,\" a mortuary temple built in a unique style which, according to some archaeologists, inspired later Classical architecture in the Mediterranean. The area near the temple became known as the \"Valley of the Kings,\" and was one of the most important burial places in ancient Egypt.

70122,"It is a glorious day for Pharaoh Totmes III. All of Canaan has been added to the Empire and Egypt has reached its greatest territorial extent. The scribes will write of this day and your exploits will be read for eternity. The pharaoh will need your services again, however. These conquests have brought Egypt face to face with another empire which contests Egypt's claims to these lands. Prepare your battle chariot as you may soon find yourself at war with the Hittites."
70123,"Instead of taking the lead in the initial attack and pushing through to the enemy lines as expected of a great general, you became scared and ran at the first sight of blood. Even the pharaoh himself witnessed your cowardice, and has called for you to be slowly impaled on your own unused sword."
70124,"For the first 22 years of his reign, Totmes III co-ruled Egypt with his aunt, Hatszepsut . During their rule, the two monarchs were equals and divided the ruling tasks between themselves. Totmes III led the Egyptian armies, an experience which would prove useful later during his own reign. After the death of Hatszepsut , Totmes III became sole ruler and started to remove all texts referring to his aunt. Under his rule, Egypt reached her greatest territorial extent. In seventeen campaigns, Totmes III conquered Syria and the Levant in the north and Nubia to the Fourth Cataract in the south.\n\nOne of the most important events in Totmes III's campaigns was the Battle of Megiddo in Canaan. The Canaanite city-states had united under the leadership of the kings of two cities: Megiddo and Kadesh. They mustered an army which threatened Totmes III's forces. The Egyptians defeated this Canaanite army, which retreated to the city of Megiddo. After a long siege, the city was taken, pillaged, and its inhabitants put to death. The Battle of Megiddo is the earliest battle in history to have been recorded in relatively reliable detail.\n\nThutmose III's successors were often equally successful and powerful. Amenhotep III brought Egypt to its cultural, political, and economic height. Instead of using force to coerce neighbors into fulfilling Egypt's interests, Amenhotep III relied on diplomacy and the vast wealth of his kingdom. The Egyptian Empire enjoyed stability during his reign and the reigns of his successors, except for a series of clashes between the followers of the cults of Amun and Aten. The priests of Amun had become very powerful and certain pharaohs attempted to weaken the cult's power by strengthening the rival cult of Aten. Amenhotep III's son, Amenhotep IV, was one such pharaoh. Taking the name Akhenaten in honor of the god Aten, he disrupted traditional Egyptian religion by establishing a quasi-monotheistic religion. After his death, however, the cult of Amun was restored to prominence.\n\nBeginning in the 12th century BCE, migrating peoples armed with iron weapons descended on the Bronze Age civilizations of the Near East, a period known as the Bronze Age Collapse. Around 1175 BCE, Pharaoh Ramesses III defeated an invasion by the Sea Peoples, delaying Egypt's ruination. After his death, however, Egypt declined and would eventually be occupied by foreign powers, such as the Nubians, Assyrians, and Persians."


70210,"Mycenae, 1600 BCE\n\nThe Mediterranean climate of the Peloponnese region is well suited to agriculture. To thrive and expand in an increasingly hostile world, however, your people must take possession of suitable forage lands. Three other groups already inhabit this area—of the three, the Pelasgians are the strongest. Establish five Farms to sustain the agricultural needs of your people, and destroy all Pelasgian Farms to deal a crippling blow to your most powerful neighbor. It may be necessary to eliminate the Achaeans or Danaans to obtain a foothold in this region before taking the fight to the Pelasgians.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy all Pelasgian Farms.\n• Build 5 Farms."

70212,"Your victory over the neighboring chiefdoms has ensured that your people have access to the most fertile land available to sow their crops. The Pelasgians, Achaeans, and Danaans have all Dowolnie submitted to your rule, or fled into neighboring regions to lick their wounds. Your people can now focus on building settlements, establishing trade routes, and spreading their influence into neighboring areas."
70213,"Your people fought valiantly, but they lacked the charismatic leadership of their adversaries. Constant enemy raids have broken your will and forced you into the barren, harsh lands that the other inhabitants find undesirable. Living off what little can be gleaned from the unforgiving landscape, your people dream of a day when a more capable leader will rise up and show them a glimpse of a brighter future."
70214,"Mycenaean civilization first developed in the Argolis region of the Peloponnese, but soon spread to many of the neighboring lands. The early Mycenaean economy was primarily based on a combination of agriculture and pastoralism, centered on the cultivation of cereal crops and the keeping of livestock. When improved farming techniques increased agricultural efficiency, Mycenaean society complexified considerably, allowing for a division of labor and significant expansion. The Mycenaeans developed new industries, including—but not limited to—pottery, metalworking, shipbuilding, and trade with neighboring regions. They excelled at the smithing of bronze and other metals, crafting works of art, and forging various tools and weapons of war with which to combat their enemies. One of the most famous artifacts of the period is the so-called Mask of Agamemnon, a gold burial mask dating to the 16th century BCE.\n\nAlthough the Greek climate was generally favorable, much of the land was rugged and mountainous, and fertile farmland was limited. Competition over farmland and mineral resources fostered conflict between neighboring groups and the city-states that later emerged. Chiefdoms warred with each other constantly, and while pitched battles were rare, warfare often involved the destruction of enemy agriculture and the theft of enemy cattle—attacks designed to cripple the ability of the enemy to obtain food. Crops were burned, olive trees were felled, and livestock were stolen or slain on the spot. As a result, settlements tended to shift from locations near farmland to hilltop citadels—or akropoleon, as the Greeks called them—that were more readily defensible.\n\nMycenaean societies coalesced around these fortified settlements. The common people were ruled by a warrior elite, often with a king at the head, known in the local language as a wanax. Funerary practices complexified around this time, and much of the archaeological evidence of Mycenaean culture available to historians is found in burial sites. Although conflict was common, city-states tended to show preference towards building diplomatic relationships and economic connections with their neighbors, and later expanding those overseas. Mycenaean artifacts have been discovered in numerous coastal locations around the Aegean Sea, and even as far away as Cyprus, Egypt, and the Phoenician homeland in the eastern Mediterranean."

70220,"Mycenae, 1400 BCE\n\nYour people are now largely settled, and they have prospered for the past several generations. You are not alone, however—other city-states have risen and begun to expand as well. As border clashes begin, it becomes clear that growth is possible only at the expense of neighboring rivals. The Tirynians covet the lands that you now control, and have begun to aggressively press the issue. This outrage must not be allowed to continue. Secure your control over this region by capturing the ancient Ruins close to the nearby town of Tiryns. Build two Sentry Towers adjacent to the Ruins to deter any further enemy incursions.\n\nCele:\n• Capture the Ruins.\n• Construct 2 Sentry Towers beside the Ruins."

70222,"The demoralized Tirynian troops flee before the blades of your disciplined soldiers! With the ruins and mineral resources of the region secured, the conflict will surely not last much longer. Soon, your enemies will humbly kneel before you, offering their wealth and begging for peace. With the nearby region secured, your people can now look beyond their borders, making alliances and even expanding overseas. Lead them onward!"
70223,"Alas! Your armies marched into battle, but most did not return. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered by their Tirynian foes, they fell like stalks of wheat before a scythe. The survivors have regrouped for a final stand, but the future looks bleak. The Tirynians descend upon you, the spirit of Nike, the goddess of victory, at their backs. It will not be long before you are all slain or carried off into slavery."
70224,"As the Mycenaeans gradually became more established in the region, their settlements and lifestyle grew increasingly complex. One particularly notable development was the construction of palace complexes, known in the local language as megaron. From within these, the wanax (king) of each growing city-state watched their realm carefully. As territorial borders expanded, aspirations did as well, and city-states found themselves locked in deadly conflicts over farmland, mineral resources, lumber sources, and trade routes. The most notable of these city-states was located at Mycenae, where nineteenth-century excavations unearthed large fortifications, a sophisticated palace complex and priceless treasures, many lying in burial mounds. Other significant centers of power included Tiryns, Argos, Pylos, and Menelaion, near the modern city of Sparta.\n\nDespite the volatile and variable political situation, the Mycenaean people who were spread across Attica, Boeotia, and the Peloponnese had a considerable amount in common. They shared an early form of the Greek language, polytheistic religious systems, and common cultural norms.\n\nThe Mycenaeans were almost certainly extremely warlike, as shown by numerous fortifications and various art forms valorizing warfare, such as ceramic artwork, wall frescoes, carvings, and funerary objects.\n\nThe palace complexes on the acropolis of a town served as both government and military centers. The king and the nobility ruled from a position of strength, and soldiers could be drilled nearby and outfitted with weaponry from the armory. In times of war, the acropolis was a secure place to take refuge from invaders, and the surplus food stored in the local granary could sustain a citadel under attack until the siege was broken or abandoned. It was often more prudent to destroy a city-state's economic wealth: farmland, crops, pastures, mineral deposits, port (if applicable), and trade routes. The Mycenaean city-states gradually formed alliances and trading agreements, however, and often displayed a loose sort of solidarity when facing outsiders."

70232,"Fueled by fury at the treachery of the Minoans, your men struck back decisively. The Minoan temple lies destroyed, a smoldering ruin and a warning to any who should attempt such deceitful actions in the future. Your soldiers rejoice at their victory, pillaging the Minoan lands, carrying off their wealth, and enjoying countless casks of Cretan wine.

70233,"Having suffered disastrous losses to the Minoan betrayal, only a handful of your men made it off the island. They were soon hunted down and slain, but you were not so lucky. For weeks now, you have languished in a dark cell, living off worms and dirt. You nurture the faint hope that some of your men might have escaped and could return with reinforcements, but with each passing day that notion becomes more and more bleak. The door to your cell opens, and a pair of guards drag you out to your execution. Meet your fate without fear…"
70234,"The Minoan culture formed a robust presence on the island of Crete and the surrounding seas for over two millennia, lasting roughly from 3600 BCE to 1420 BCE. The causes of its decline are not entirely clear, although the catastrophic eruption of Thera, which devastated much of the eastern Mediterranean, stands out as a likely culprit. The damage that the eruption and its aftermath caused to Minoan Crete, and many of their trading partners, probably hamstrung their economy, which was dependent on the commercial import and export of goods.\n\nMinoan Crete was marked by numerous impressive institutions and advancements, particularly in the spheres of seafaring and writing. The Minoans were adept at navigating the Mediterranean, making contact and trading with many neighboring cultures across the sea. This legacy was represented in their art, particularly through the stunning frescoes of watercraft, fishermen, and sea life that adorn their artifacts. Their economy was predicated on trade and domination of the nearby sea routes, not on agriculture as was primarily the case in neighboring regions. Their settlements and palaces were relatively minimally fortified, demonstrating a reliance on their naval forces to stave off invasions.\n\nThrough contact with eastern cultures in Egypt, Lebanon, and Canaan, the Minoans acquired not only wealth but also various technological and intellectual advancements. However, such monumental success inevitably drew the attention of their neighbors. Sometime between the late 15th and early 14th centuries BCE (accounts vary), the Minoan palace centers were overrun by Mycenaean invaders. It is probable that the Mycenaeans observed the declining trend of Minoan civilization in the period following the natural disasters that befell the region, and determined that the time was right to strike decisively and eliminate a rival."

70240,"Ilium, 1194 BCE\n\nThe overseas expansion of the Mycenaeans has brought them into contact with other cultures that simultaneously pose opportunities and dangers. In a defiant but inspired act, Paris, prince of Troy (also called Ilium), has kidnapped the beautiful Helen of Sparta and taken her back to his home. The fury of your brother Menelaus, Helen's husband and king of Sparta, knows no bounds, and he has appealed to you, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, for help. Jumping at the opportunity for war and renown, you have assembled a vast army bent on the destruction of Troy. The city-state lies far across the Aegean Sea, however, and the campaign will require a strong navy to launch a seaborne invasion of the Trojan heartland. Go forth dauntlessly—eternal fame and glory await!\n\nCele:\n• Hector, prince of Troy, must be slain.\n• Paris, prince of Troy, must be slain.\n• Capture the Treasure of Priam."
70241,"1. Establish supremacy at sea to control offshore resources and clear the way for your invasion.\n2. You will need a large force to overcome the Trojan defenses.\n3. Agamemnon's army is restricted to the Bronze Age—you cannot advance to the Era Êelaza."
70242,"Just when all seemed lost, the scheme of wily Odysseus, king of Ithaca, has succeeded! Grey-eyed Athena surely smiles upon you, as the Trojans, drunk on the euphoria of their supposed victory, carelessly threw caution to the wind. They dragged Odysseus' work—a large wooden horse containing a band of your finest men—inside the city. In the dark of the night, your men emerged and opened the gates to the city. The air is filled with the fearful yells of the surprised Trojans as your intrepid warriors flood through the streets, torching the city and carrying its wealth and enslaved population back to your ships."
70243,"With the death of the great Achilles, the will of your troops was broken. In a stunning and bold maneuver, the Trojan army fearlessly sallied forth from the gates of Ilium, the memory of the slain Hector still fresh in their minds. Your rudimentary fortifications were no match for the Trojan onslaught, and the arrows of Apollo rained down from the sky, striking droves of your troops dead. With your army decimated, and most of your fleet burned, you have no choice but to return to Mycenae in ignominy."
70244,"Despite its rich narrative and spectacular level of detail, the Homeric Iliad and its tale of the Trojan War was widely considered to be fictitious until the archaeological discoveries of Heinrich Schliemann in the 19th century. Schliemann made a fantastic set of discoveries at a dig site near Hisarlik in the northwest region of modern-day Turkey. The archaeological site was situated upon the lucrative trade route leading from the Aegean through the Bosphorus to the Black Sea, providing a plausible incentive for the historical conflict.\n\nAs time went on, numerous levels of the city were unearthed. One location, known now as Troy VII-a, corresponds remarkably well to the dates of the Trojan War given by several classical historians and chroniclers. Additionally, analysis of its destruction layer yielded remnants of weapons of war and evidence that the city was obliterated by fire, aligning with ancient and classical accounts of the conclusion of the conflict. Cross-examination of Hittite texts with the archaeological evidence linked Troy (Ilium) with a great city called Wilusa by the Hittites, which was destroyed by invaders from the west known to them as Ahhiyawa, or Homer's Achaeans.\n\nAccording to the Homeric narrative (and several classical myths and tales that grew from it), the conflict was caused by the abduction of Helen of Sparta by Paris, a prince of Troy, with the help of the goddess Aphrodite. After much difficulty, the Mycenaeans (referred to in the epic as Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives) crossed the Aegean into Asia Minor and laid siege to the city for ten long years. As the fighting wore on, claiming heroic warriors from both sides, the morale of the Mycenaeans dwindled. Finally, the cunning Odysseus devised a perilous plan to break the stalemate. Constructing a giant wooden horse containing a band of brave warriors, the Mycenaeans then sailed away, hiding their fleet behind the nearby island of Tenedos. The Trojans, desiring not to offend the gods, brought the horse inside the city, allowing the hidden warriors to open the gates in the dark of night. The Mycenaean army stormed in and laid waste to the city, killing most of its population and carrying off its fabled wealth.\n\nThe Homeric epics, likely the most famous works in the history of Western literature, assured that the memory of the conflict would live on, etched eternally into the pages of history."

70250,"Attica, 1000 BCE\n\nThe Mycenaean civilization has fallen into ruin, and the rule of the Aegean is up for grabs. In the midst of this chaos, your city-state of Athens has managed to survive and even prosper, expanding throughout much of Attica. The local agricultural supply is not enough to support your burgeoning population, however, and before long overpopulation is sure to lead to famine and anarchy. The ruling council has decided on a bold plan to send settlers to establish overseas settlements in Ionia. The local Luwians have inhabited this region for centuries, but they are far too weak to repel your people. Demonstrate your dominance of the region by destroying three Luwian Government Centers across the sea in Ionia. Seize the initiative quickly before famine strikes, or the Luwians decide to raid Attica and the rest of Greece!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the three Luwian Government Centers."

70252,"Thanks to your charismatic leadership, the Athenians have successfully established settlements on the coast of Asia in Ionia. Other nearby city-states have followed your example, and the eastern Aegean has fallen almost entirely under Hellenic influence. As time passes, you watch with pride as settlements such as Miletus and Halicarnassus grow into successful urban centers, producing several marvelous architectural wonders; and numerous philosophers, geographers, and mathematicians. Commerce is abundant, and the growing trade routes contribute greatly to the wealth of your city-state."
70253,"Unfortunately, your settlers underestimated the resolve of the Luwians, who fought dearly to protect their homes from your incursions. Worn down by the raids of Aegean pirates, your people were no match for the Luwian onslaught. You and the few survivors had no choice but to flee and sail back to Athens, where you expect to see your name etched on thousands of ostrakon."
70254,"In the centuries following the Trojan War, Mycenaean society experienced a swift decline. The exact causes are unknown, although common hypotheses have involved massive Dorian invasions or infighting among the various Mycenaean city-states. Archaeological evidence and tablets bearing inscriptions in Linear B, an early form of Greek, point to clear episodes of warfare and wholesale destruction of numerous Mycenaean urban centers. This catastrophe ushered in a period of political chaos and uncertainty commonly termed the Greek Dark Ages.\n\nNotably, the city-state of Athens survived this turmoil relatively intact, perhaps due to the defensible nature of its impressive acropolis. Seizing the opportunity to fill the power vacuum presented by the fall of the Mycenaean civilization, Athens consolidated its control over Attica, Euboea, and eastern Boeotia. The proximity of Attica to the Aegean Sea made it an ideal regional nucleus for a major trading power, and the Athenian population grew quickly. Before long, the Athenians were mounting expeditions to establish settlements on various coastal regions throughout the Aegean.\n\nOver the subsequent centuries, Athens evolved into a major naval power, establishing a thalassocracy (maritime empire) that controlled much of the territory surrounding the Aegean, dominating the trade economy of the region. From that center of power, the Athenians engaged in trade with numerous city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean as well as the Greek settlements in Sicily and southern Italy, a region later termed by the Romans as Magna Graecia, or Great Greece. During this time, intellectual and technological pursuits flourished throughout the Aegean. The Athenians went on to develop the first system of direct democracy in the late 6th century BCE, as well as a unique form of exile known as ostracism. Each citizen cast a vote (etched into a shard of pottery, known as ostrakon) for a person they wished to exile. If any single person received more than 6,000 votes, they were forced to leave the city-state for 10 years!"

70260,"Athens, 405 BCE\n\nOver the past several centuries, the Greek city-states have expanded their influence both in Hellas and overseas. Now, a powerful coalition led by the dual monarchy of Sparta is challenging your city-state of Athens for dominance in a conflict that has lasted three decades. In the wake of the disastrous Sicilian Expedition, Sparta has seized the initiative, claiming several key victories and drawing ever closer to Athens. You have no hope of defeating the battle-hardened Spartans in the field at present, but there is a chance that you may be able to defend the city long enough for reinforcements and supplies to arrive and turn the tide in your favor. The Spartan army is reliant on a large baggage train of supplies—if it is captured, their siege will be delayed considerably.\n\nCele:\n• Capture the Spartan baggage train (represented by four Artifacts)."
70261,"1. The Spartan army is upon us! Hurry! Get all your villagers within the city walls of Athens before it is too late!\n2. Maintain the strength of your fortifications at all costs.\n3. Send villagers to the nearby islands to seek the resources required to support your army."
70262,"Your intrepid defense has thus far parried the assaults of the feared Spartan alliance! Deprived of their supply train, the Spartans grow discouraged as they watch ships bringing provisions into Athens each day. In frustration, they have turned to pillaging the nearby countryside, while your citizens watch them from the safety of the high walls of their citadel.\n\nThis jubilation is not to last, however. Word has finally reached Athens of the Spartan victory at Aegospotomai and the destruction of the Athenian fleet. Without a navy, it will not be long before your supply lines, in turn, are cut. Perhaps the Spartans will be willing to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the war?"
70263,"The combined might of the Spartan land and naval forces was too much for your garrison. As the Spartan army advanced towards the walls of Athens, the harbor of Piraeus was blockaded by a plethora of Spartan ships, preventing any supplies from reaching the city from the Aegean. With supplies running low and morale even lower, you have no choice but to surrender to the enemy. Pray to Athena that they will be merciful!"
70264,"By the 5th century BCE, the region of Hellas (as the Greeks called modern-day Greece) was dominated by a number of several powerful city-states, such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Corinth. These city-states tended to compete with each other economically, militarily, and culturally, but were briefly galvanized by a pair of dangerous invasions conducted by the Achaemenid Empire. This period was termed as the Persian Wars, and yielded some of the most popular narratives to come out of the classical era, such as the heroic but doomed defense of the coastal passage of Thermopylae by King Leonidas of Sparta and his 300 warriors. In the wake of the victory over the Persians, the Greek city-states flourished and expanded their influence further than ever before.\n\nTwo city-states arose to prominence during this time. Athens was the leader of the powerful Delian League, a thalassocracy of city-states and territories that encompassed much of the Aegean Sea, dominating the economic climate of the region and boasting quite possibly the most powerful navy in the Mediterranean seen to date. Sparta, on the other hand, headed the fearsome Peloponnesian League, a formidable land-based power built on a slave economy and rigorous military training. Although the focus of each alliance was largely different, the tension between them began to increase as time went on.\n\nBy 431 BCE, a Theban-Spartan attack on Plataea (an Athenian ally) had drawn the Delian and Peloponnesian Leagues into a deadly war that would last nearly thirty years. Thucydides' vivid account of the events of the entire Peloponnesian War demonstrates considerable early success on the part of the Athenian navy—a success that was nevertheless tempered by the effects of a devastating plague that ravaged Attica, killing roughly half of its population. The conflict carried on for years with relatively equal victories and defeats seen by both sides, but the balance was tipped by the folly of the disastrous Sicilian Expedition of 415-413 BCE, which cost Athens 100 triremes, 30,000 oarsmen, and virtually a generation of citizen-soldiers. Their military power was crippled considerably.\n\nAlthough Athens attempted to recover over the next several years, the Spartans were able to push into Attica, while simultaneously defeating the Athenian navy at Aegospotomai in 405 BCE. Its naval supply cut, the city of Athens had no choice but to surrender to the besieging Spartans, who humbled the once-great power and ended the war. Internal difficulties plagued the Peloponnesian League, however, and democracy was soon restored in Athens."

70274,"Following the end of the Peloponnesian War after 404 BCE, numerous experienced soldiers from the various city-states found themselves to be out of work. Greek hoplites were the most formidable infantry soldiers in the West at the time, and many found employment overseas as mercenaries. In 401 BCE, Cyrus the Younger rebelled against his brother Artaxerxes II, seeking the throne of Persia for himself. The nucleus of his army was 10,000 Greek mercenaries, most of them heavy infantry.\n\nThe Greek force was originally led to believe that they were being sent on a punitive expedition into the interior of Asia Minor. When Cyrus continued to march into Mesopotamia, the mercenaries were thrilled by the prospect of further riches and glory. They met the Persian forces under Artaxerxes II at the Battle of Cunaxa, where the Greek infantry dominated the field and engineered a victory. Unfortunately, Cyrus was slain in combat, rendering the achievement null and leaving the 10,000 Greeks stranded in the heart of enemy territory.\n\nXenophon's book, The Anabasis (literally “going inland” in ancient Greek), tells the story of the harrowing expedition. The Persians, feigning peaceful intentions, summoned the Greek commanders to negotiations, where they were treacherously slain. Appointing new commanders, Xenophon among them, the company began the long journey north to a suitable port on the Black Sea. Although the Persians seldom harassed the Greeks, the elements took their toll over the next two years and only roughly 6,000 troops made it to the coast, where they reportedly rejoiced, yelling \"Thalatta! Thalatta!\" (the Greek word for the sea).\n\nThe March of the Ten Thousand is considered to be one of the greatest survival stories of all time. The tactical and logistical knowledge that the Greeks brought home proved integral to the evolution of their military structure over the following decades, as ranged and mobile units were added to the core of heavy infantry that the Greek city-states had relied upon for decades. Furthermore, the internal instabilities of the Persian Empire were made known to the Greeks, who would eventually capitalize on their advantage."

70283,"Your armies marched into Persia with the zeal of a victorious force, but for all their hubris they could not break the might of the army of Darius.

Having been humbled, you retreat to Hellas with all haste, knowing that the retaliatory Persian invasion is inevitable."
70284,"In the decades following the return of Xenophon to Hellas in 399 BCE, the various city-states continued their internecine struggle for supremacy. The powerful Spartans were brought low at Leuktra in 371 BCE by the Thebans, who briefly enjoyed their dominant position before being challenged by an Athenian-Spartan alliance at Mantinea in 362 BCE. The regional balance of power remained in a peaceful status quo for a time, but near-perpetual warfare had weakened the city-states considerably.\n\nA new power rose to the north in Macedonia to fill this vacuum. King Philip of Macedon made substantial strides in the development of Hellenistic battle strategy and tactics, combining the traditional core of heavy infantry with light skirmishing troops, as well as potent light and heavy cavalry forces. The Macedonian phalanx (a troop formation), surrounded by corps of peltasts (javelin throwers), hypaspists (shield-bearing spearmen), slingers (hurling stones or lead pellets), prodromoi (light cavalry), and elite companion cavalry, soon claimed mastery over most of Hellas.\n\nFollowing his assassination in 336 BCE, Philip was succeeded as king of Macedon by his son Alexander, who would later be known as \"the Great\" and widely regarded as one of history's most capable tacticians, and charismatic commanders. After a brief series of campaigns in which he crushed local revolts and solidified his control of Hellas, Alexander's army crossed the Dardanelles and pushed into the great Achaemenid Persian Empire, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of the Granicus River in 334 BCE. The Persians were utterly stunned by the capability of the young leader.\n\nAlexander's army knifed through Asia Minor and into the heart of the Achaemenid Empire, winning a decisive victory at Issus in 333 BCE, and conducting a series of successful sieges. The most notable of these was at Tyre, a siege that involved the construction of a massive causeway allowing the Macedonians to seize the island city. A series of victories followed, most prominently at Gaugamela in 331 BCE. Soon all of Persia was beneath his heel. This series of conquests ushered in an age of prosperity marked by the flow of Hellenistic ideas into Alexander's new dominions and vice versa, creating a legacy that would last for centuries."

																																																																																																																																		  
																																																																																														
																																																																																																																																		  
																																																																																														

70310,"Mesopotamia, 1760 BCE\n\nThe small city state of Babylon is growing under the energetic leadership of its new king, Hammurabi. You have been sent down river to bring some enclaves of Sumerians and Akkadians into the fold. Use your powers of persuasion when you can, but do not hesitate to resort to war if they prove to be resistant.\n\nCele:\n• Convert or destroy the Sumerians.\n• Convert or destroy the Akkadians."
70311,"1. Use your Kapîan to convert enemy villagers and military units. It is important that your Kapîan does not die until you have at least converted one or more villagers and can build a base.\n2. The town to the east may be your best bet for establishing a quick foothold, as it is the weakest of the two.\n3. The Babylonians are restricted to the Bronze Age—you cannot advance to the Era Êelaza."
70312,"You have managed to capture both Akkad and Sumer, reestablishing a great part of Sargon's old empire. With Babylonian rule extended to the other city states, you can bring Hammurabi's law code to them, and ensure further peace and stability in the empire. However, there is no time to revel in your success. The people in the Zagros mountains are restless and threaten the peace. Hammurabi has called upon your services once again to deal with them."
70313,"In view of your failure to subdue your neighbors, the future of Babylon has become bleak. It is unlikely that it will ever grow outside its initial borders, and it will forever remain a minor city in Mesopotamia, overshadowed by other older and more powerful states like Assyria and Elam. Maybe a life in the military was not for you after all. Your fellow citizens suggest that you take a job as a bricklayer at the local Ziggurat instead."
70314,"Before the rise of the Babylonian Empire, Mesopotamia had been ruled by the ancient inhabitants of Sumer, downriver from Babylon. However, with the decline of this civilization, a new people to the north, called the Akkadians, rose to prominence. Their king, Sargon, conquered the entire region and united the Sumerians and Akkadians, creating the first great empire in Mesopotamia around 2350 BCE. This empire stretched from the Persian Gulf to Anatolia, but crumbled by 2230 BCE due to internal rebellions and the invasions of Gutian tribesmen from the Zagros Mountains to the east, and semi-nomadic Amorites from the northwest. To what extent Sargon's empire was an actual empire is still debated. Sources mention trade routes with India and the Arabian Peninsula, and expeditions to Syria and the Levant; but it seems that most cities in Mesopotamia still enjoyed a large amount of autonomy, and that military expeditions were issued with the objective of securing trade and extending the Akkadian sphere of influence, rather than full-on conquest.\n\nAfter the fall of Sargon's empire, Mesopotamia came under the influence of the Gutians and Amorites. Nevertheless, the city state of Ur managed to resist them, and its leaders became the kings of Sumer and Akkad, founding the dynasty of Ur. The Gutians disappeared as a power, but the Amorites, on the other hand, were persistent and slowly displaced the local rulers. The dynasty of Ur started to decline and was replaced by small Amorite and Akkadian states. \n\nHammurabi inherited the city-state of Babylon, one of these smaller Amorite states, in 1792 BCE. At that time, Babylon only consisted of the city and its farmlands, and was surrounded by similarly small kingdoms centered on other minor cities. Hammurabi’s first act was to unite all the cities and city-states of southern Mesopotamia, forming one larger kingdom, ruled from mighty Babylon."

70320,"Tigris Valley, 1755 BCE\n\nThe addition of the Sumerian and Akkadian cities to the rising Babylonian Empire pleases Hammurabi greatly. Now, he sets a more difficult task for you. One of our frontier cities was recently sacked and important treasures, including a copy of Hammurabi's law code engraved in stone, were carried off to the Tigris River. Chase the raiders to where the treasures were taken and build up a force to recover them. They must not be allowed to move the treasures upstream. The prestige of your great king remains tarnished for as long as these treasures remain in enemy hands.\n\nCele:\n• Capture the 2 missing treasures (Artifacts) and return them to your side of the river."
70321,"1. A lot of the action takes place on the Tigris River, so a strong navy is key to ensuring your victory.\n2. The Babylonians are restricted to the Bronze Age—you cannot advance to the Era Êelaza."
70322,"The great king Hammurabi has died. During his lifetime, you managed to prevent raids and invasions into the Babylonian heartland, ensuring Babylon's continued success. But with Hammurabi's death, the Babylonian Empire has gradually started to decline. Only time will tell when we will have another great king such as Hammurabi to once again make Babylonia a great power."
70323,"You have failed your king, and many Babylonian cities have been plundered and razed to the ground. Hammurabi has ordered you to be attached by a rope to his chariot, and dragged along when he goes on his next campaign."
70324,"After succeeding in uniting all Sumerian, Amorite and Akkadian city-states along the banks of the two rivers, Hammurabi invaded and conquered Elam to the east and the kingdoms of Mari and Ebla to the northwest. This secured Babylon's eastern borders, which had always been prone to raids by its neighbors from the Zagros mountains. Late in his reign, Hammurabi attacked Assyria, then still called Subartu, and forced them to pay tribute to Babylonia, making Babylonian rule over the Euphrates and Tigris rivers complete. Under his rule, the Babylonian Empire became a great power in the region. The city of Babylon itself grew into a vast and holy city. But upon Hammurabi's death in 1750 BCE, the Empire of Babylonia gradually started to decline, disintegrating into smaller states. Nevertheless, the citadel of Babylon managed to remain a large urban center because of its strong position, reputation, and many trade routes.\n\nNowadays, Hammurabi is most remembered for the Code of Hammurabi, which is one of the best-preserved law codes from ancient times. The code was carved into a great stele (stone slab), and contains 280 judgments on civil and criminal law, dealing mainly with matters related to everyday life such as corrupt administrations, theft, receiving stolen goods, robbery, looting, murder, abduction, taxes, merchant relations, slavery, divorces, dowries, and inheritances. Remarkably, the expression \"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\" is also inscribed in the code—a saying which has survived until the present day. Although it is not the only law code from that period, it is the most well-known and extensively researched of them all, and yields a great deal of insight into ancient societies."

70330,"Euphrates River Bank, 1595 BCE\n\nDisaster has struck - a Hittite army has marched down the shore of the Euphrates River and sacked Babylon! Although your party is isolated among enemies in the marsh lands, this is our only hope for exacting vengeance on the raiders. A Hittite force remains in the area, trying to gather more loot. Clear your enemies from the marsh lands and burn the Hittite encampment to the ground!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Hittite Army (Brown).\n• Take back the ruined city of Babylon (Ruins)."
70331,"1. You can find many resources across the river, but beware the Hittite pillagers that are ravaging the Babylonian countryside.\n2. Once you establish a strong navy, you will be able to clear the region of enemies and prepare to raid the enemy camp.\n3. Several of your soldiers have fled the city and are currently hiding in the countryside. They will join you, provided that you can locate them."
70332,"This is a sad day for the Babylonians because our city has been sacked and our future is grim. At least our soldiers can return home, knowing that they have done everything they could to prevent this disaster."
70333,"Not only have the Hittites sacked our city, but they have also taken all our treasures and idols. No one will ever remember the great city of Babylon, and its legacy is lost forever."
70334,"Around 1595 BCE, roughly 150 years after the death of Hammurabi, a Hittite raid under Mursilis I ravaged the weakened Babylonian state. The Hittites dethroned the last Babylonian ruler and sacked Babylon, putting an end to the empire founded by Hammurabi. With Babylon out of the picture, powers such as the Hurrian and Mitanni kingdoms managed to penetrate deeper into former northern Babylonian territory, while a semi-nomadic people named the Kassites moved into the region between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. The Kassites had started to encroach in increasing numbers on former Babylonian lands from 1800 BCE onwards, and managed to conquer the local Amorite and Akkadian states by 1450 BCE. The Kassite dynasty remained on the throne for many centuries to come, unlike the Hurrian and Mitanni kingdoms that were incorporated into the kingdoms of the Hittites and Assyrians."

70340,"Babylon, 1185 – 1155 BCE\n\nFollowing the Hittite sack of Babylon, the city has come under the dominion of the Kassites, who have controlled it for nearly 500 years. Kassite rule is in danger, however, because of Elamite and Assyrian intrusions. Another Elamite army is pressing forward at this moment and is moving to take Babylon. If the city cannot be held, you are to save what you can, retreat downriver, and build up a new army. When you are prepared, retake the city of Babylon and destroy the invading Elamites.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Elamites."
70341,"1. Escape may be your only answer.\n2. Look east for resources required for a victorious return to the city."
70342,"Even though we lost the war against the Elamites, there is a silver lining in it all. Our Kassite overlords have fallen, and their dynasty has been overthrown. The new army you have built can serve the new Babylonian king. Under him, we will be able to restore Babylon to its former glory."
70343,"Our lands have been ravaged by the Elamites! Although the Kassite dynasty is weak, we do not have the means to overthrow them. It seems that we will be forced to endure their rule for yet another 500 years."
70344,"Although the beginning of the Kassite rule over Babylonia cannot be dated, it is known that their king Agum II ruled over parts of western Iran and the middle part of the Euphrates valley. Native Babylonian princes continued to reign in southern Babylonia in the interim until the Kassite king Ulamburiash finally annexed this region around 1450 BCE. The Kassite rulers had strong international ambitions, and they established diplomatic ties with Egypt to trade gems for gold and to establish royal marriages. Their ambitions, however, brought them in conflict with the Assyrians, and so they allied with the Hittites to stop the rapid expansion of the Assyrians. During the reign of Kashtiliash IV in the 13th century BCE, Babylonia waged a destructive war on two fronts against the Assyrians and Elamites, which resulted in the catastrophic invasion and destruction of Babylon by the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I in 1225 BCE. Their Hittite allies suffered a similar defeat, resulting in the loss of Hittite territory in Asia Minor and the Levant to the Assyrians. After this disaster, the Babylonians slowly recovered and once again experienced a period of prosperity and peace in the following years. However, when another war with Elam broke out in 1185 BCE, the Kassite dynasty was ultimately crushed and replaced by a native dynasty from the city-state of Isin."

70350,"Karun River near Susa, 1120 BCE\n\nThe glory of Babylon has been restored by the reconquest of lands formerly lost to the Elamites, and by ejecting the foreign Kassite rulers from our territories. However, King Nebuchadnezzar I vows that taking back former Babylonian land is not enough. The Elamites must feel his wrath in their homeland. Nebuchadnezzar I has ordered you to attack Susa, the capital of the Elamites, just across the Karun river. In one of their previous raids, the Elamites carted off a golden statue of the most important god of the Babylonians; Marduk. Your task is to recapture it to strengthen Nebuchadnezzar's legitimacy back home. Peoples long oppressed by the Elamites will give you aid in your quest if you can locate them.\n\nCele:\n• Capture the Artifact."
70351,"1. The long road ahead is paved with many obstacles. Sometimes it is better to race through a hotspot than to stand and fight.\n2. Gather as many allies as you can along your way—you will need them in the end.\n3. Landing an army near Susa is a daunting task. Use the shallows around the city to land priests and catapults in range of the city's defenses and destroy them from a distance.\n4. On your way, you will have the chance to obtain a few villagers. Use them to build up your force before attacking the city of Susa."
70352,"You have sacked Susa and defeated the Elamites, a magnificent achievement that will be remembered for ages. Now, all that remains for you to do is safely return the statue of Marduk to Babylon, along with the loot that we took from Susa."
70353,"Your expedition into the Elamite homeland has ended catastrophically. With our army destroyed and our most holy artifact in the hands of our enemies, the people of Babylonia have lost faith in their king. In turn, Nebuchadnezzar I has lost his faith in you, and he intends to strap you to a ballista bolt the next time the Elamites besiege our cities. Maybe then you can be of some use after all."
70354,"With the Kassite dynasty overthrown, Marduk-kabit-ahheshu established what came to be known as the second dynasty of Isin in the 12th century BCE. However, this did not end hostilities with Babylon's Assyrian and Elamite neighbors, and Marduk-kabit-ahheshu waged wars against them to strengthen his new dynasty. Because of these early hostilities, his successors often needed to continue the fighting to maintain control over Babylonia, thus perpetuating hostilities between the three empires for decades. The most famous king of them all, Nebuchadnezzar I, fought such a campaign against Elam. The Elamites had conquered and ravaged a large part of Babylonia and were threatening the fragile city-state. A first attack on Elam failed due to an epidemic among Nebuchadnezzar's troops, but in a later campaign the Babylonian monarch succeeded in conquering and pillaging Susa, the capital of Elam. "

70360,"Eastern Mesopotamia, 1119 BCE\n\nThe raid into Elam was successful and the statue of Marduk has been recovered, but it must be returned to Babylonia. There are still bands of Elamites and other enemies roaming the Zagros Mountains who wish to prevent the return of the statue. Bring the statue safely to your frontier Âwiçtynia where it can be guarded prior to being moved to Babylon.\n\nCele:\n• Return the statue of Marduk (Artifact) to its proper place (Âwiçtynia)."
70361,"1. Choose your path carefully—you can go Dowolnie east or west. Both routes contain different enemies and opportunities.\n2. Be cautious when spending your small stockpile of resources. It is preferable to use it for technologies that improve your units.\n3. Once you have cleared a path to the Âwiçtynia, you can try to rush your Artifact to it as a last resort."
70362,"After your campaign in Elam and the sack of their capital, the Elamite king was murdered. Now, his kingdom is falling apart, and the Elamites are in disarray. It is unlikely that they will dare to attack our lands again soon. While you return the golden statue of the god Marduk to its temple in Babylon, you are welcomed by a large mass of cheering people in the streets."
70363,"You have defeated the Elamites but failed to return the statue of Marduk to Babylonia. Our king is not completely displeased, but in the future, he will reserve the more important tasks for people who can fulfill their promises."
70364,"According to later writers, Nebuchadnezzar found a stolen Babylonian statue of the god Marduk in the Elamite capital of Susa and returned it to its rightful place in Babylon. Soon after Nebuchadnezzar's successful expedition in Elam, their king was assassinated, and his kingdom fell apart into small states. This enabled the Babylonians to focus on other regions of the empire, and there was peace in Babylonian lands for a long period of time. During Nebuchadnezzar's reign, there were many extensive building projects, which further strengthened Babylon's position as one of the most prestigious and holiest cities of Mesopotamia. After Nebuchadnezzar I's death, his brother Marduk-nadin-ahhe took the throne and fought a costly war against the Assyrians, which finally ended in a major defeat for him. Weakened by war and a great famine ravaging the country, the empire was dealt its final blow by the invasion of Aramaean tribes. Under the next several kings, the empire further disintegrated due to the continuous invasions of Semitic nomads, until once again a Kassite dynasty took over control over Babylonia in the 11th century BCE.\n\nThe god Marduk was the most important of the Babylonian deities during Nebuchadnezzar's time. The older Sumerian pantheon had about 2,000 gods, but slowly they were integrated with other gods or goddesses with similar functions, reducing the overall amount to about fifteen greater gods and hundreds of minor gods. According to ancient poets, Marduk began his existence as an equal of one of the many gods of Babylon. But then, after destroying the powers of chaos, he was elevated to the status of king over all other deities. To better integrate with the native people of Mesopotamia, the Kassites too made Marduk their most important god, and so further strengthened his position as head of the Babylonian pantheon. For almost 1,000 years, the epic of Marduk's victory over the forces of anarchy was recited during the New Year’s festival in the spring as part of the cult of Marduk in Babylon."

70370,"The Euphrates River, 748 – 734 BCE\n\nBabylonia has succumbed to the continuous invasions of the Aramaeans—yet another semi-nomadic tribe from the west. The empire has been reduced to poverty and our kings hold onto little more than their grand titles. Things are about to change, however—an Assyrian general named Tiglath-Pileser has rebelled against his king and has taken the throne. He is willing to support our new king Nabonassar to retake land lost to the Aramaeans, our common enemy. Nabonassar commands you to revitalize the Babylonian armies and destroy the invaders encroaching on our territory.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Northern Aramaeans (Red).\n• Destroy the Western Aramaeans across the river (Yellow)."
70371,"1. Prepare your defenses quickly, for there are enemies on all sides. The Babylonians have excellent walls and towers, so make use of them.\n2. Do not attack until you are prepared to face the enemy at full strength.\n3. The Assyrian king has promised you help. You can find his reinforcements in the desert to the east and on the river to the north."
70372,"You have achieved a great feat by defeating our enemies, and Nabonassar has promoted you to field general. For as long as Nabonassar lives, Babylonia will be independent. What will happen after he dies is yet to be seen."
70373,"The Babylonian army has been crushed, and yet again Babylon has come under the rule of a foreign king. The new ruler has demanded you to come to his court and entertain him as the king's buffoon."
70374,"Despite many years of conflict and a raid on Babylon itself by the Assyrians, the threat of the Aramaeans and other Semitic nomadic tribes forced Babylonia and Assyria to make peace to deal with the repeated attacks of these people. Even though the Babylonian kings still assumed grand titles, they were unable to stop the disintegration of the Babylonian Empire. The years between c. 1000 BCE and c. 750 BCE were marked by Aramaean invasions; and although the Babylonians and Assyrians were struggling to repel them, the Assyrians nevertheless succeeded in managing the situation better than the Babylonians. In the 9th century BCE, the Assyrians incorporated large parts of Mesopotamia that had been conquered by the Aramaeans, encountering little resistance from the Babylonians who instead had to deal with palace intrigues and usurpers.\n\nAfter 780 BCE, the Assyrian power started to decline when considerable lands in the north and west were lost and the general Tiglath-pileser deposed the former Assyrian king, thus creating the Neo-Assyrian Empire. This gave the Babylonians a chance under their new king Nabonassar to restore some of Babylonia's former power. Nabonassar allied himself with the new Assyrian king, Tiglath-pileser III, and together they defeated the Aramaeans, after which the two kings continued to pursue amicable relationships, and Tiglath-pileser III visited the cities and temples in Babylonia. Nabonassar retained his independence, even though Assyria quickly recovered from the power change and Tiglath-pileser III brought Assyria to its greatest territorial expansion after conquering Syria, Armenia and Israel. However, when Nabonassar died, so did the friendly relationship between Babylonia and Assyria. During the reign of Nabonassar’s successors, Tiglath-pileser III conquered Babylonia, dethroned the king, and assumed a Babylonian name, making himself the king of Assyria and Babylonia, thus ending its independence and incorporating it into the Assyrian Empire.\n\nAfter Tiglath-pileser's death, the new Assyrian Empire kept on growing, expanding further into Egypt, Asia Minor, Elam and even into what is now Iran, making it the largest empire in the entirety of the Middle East at that time. After several rebellions by the Babylonians during the 7th century BCE, the Assyrian king Sennacherib retaliated against the rebellious city. In 689 BCE, Babylon was conquered and completely destroyed, its temples plundered and leveled. The waters of the Arakhtu Canal were diverted over the ruins, and the inner city remained almost completely uninhabited for eight years. These harsh measures also upset many Assyrians because they too considered Babylon to be a holy city."

70380,"Nineveh, 612 BCE\n\nFinally, Babylonia has been liberated from Assyrian oppression. Civil wars, rebellions and foreign invasions have brought the once-mighty empire to its knees. The Assyrians have fallen back behind the imposing walls of their capital at Nineveh while an army of Babylonians and Medes converge on the capital of Assyria. Destroy the Cud in Nineveh to break the power of the Assyrians indefinitely.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Cud in Nineveh."
70381,"1. You and your allies are in a disadvantageous position. It is vital to your success to quickly turn the odds and gain control over major resource deposits.\n2. Katapultas are your best chance of destroying enemy walls. Use these weapons wisely to gain control of the map.\n3. The Medes are sending their best soldiers and ships to help tear down the walls of Nineveh. Your scouts report that they will arrive from the northeast."
70382,"Nineveh has been destroyed and the Assyrian Empire has been broken. A new era has arrived—one of Babylonian rule. The coalition congratulates you on a job well done."
70383,"Our siege has failed and the coalition has broken down, bickering amongst themselves like little children. The Assyrians once more have managed to take power and re-establish their rule over our people. Somehow, you were never to be heard of again, but rumors circulate that you were sold to the Scythians where you spent the rest of your life scooping up horse manure."
70384,"In the 7th century BCE, a series of wars erupted between the Assyrian Empire and the people it had subdued. The king of Babylonia, who was the brother of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, formed a secret alliance with the Medes, Elamites, Aramaeans, Arabs and Egyptians to overthrow his brother. When the Elamites were defeated prematurely, the king of Babylonia decided to act calling upon the alliance to go to war (in 652 BCE). However, the rebellion was crushed, and Ashurbanipal captured Babylon, eliminating his brother who died in his palace when it was set ablaze. A series of punitive attacks were launched by the Assyrians to deal with those who dared rise against them. The Arabs were quickly defeated, and Elam became an Assyrian province after their capital, Susa had been destroyed. The rest of Ashurbanipal's reign was more peaceful, and Assyria reached the zenith of its power. At this point in history, Babylonia was surpassed culturally and economically by Assyria.\n\nThe tide turned when, in 635 BCE, a civil war erupted in the Assyrian heartland, and they could no longer fight off foreign invasions. In 626 BCE, the Chaldeans, who had settled in southern Babylonia, revolted in Uruk and occupied Babylon, while the Scythians laid waste to Syria and Palestine. In 625 BCE, Cyaxares of the Medes, began to conquer the eastern provinces of Assyria. Then, a combined army of Chaldean Babylonians and Medes marched on Nineveh. A former attempt by the Medes to take the city had been thwarted by the Scythians, but in 612 BCE the Medes and Babylonians succeeded in destroying Nineveh and, with it, the Assyrian Empire. The invaders took their revenge on the local inhabitants and, 200 years later, Xenophon (a Greek mercenary serving the king of the Persian Empire) found the country sparsely populated. In a few decades, the mighty Assyrians went from capturing Babylon (648 BCE) and Susa (639 BCE) to ceasing to exist as an empire.\n\nWith Assyria gone as a major power, several new ones rose in its place: The Median Empire in Iran, a new Egyptian Kingdom in Egypt, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the rest of the Middle East. Babylonia entered its last period of glory with Nebuchadnezzar II as its most successful king, remembered best for capturing Jerusalem, capital of Judah, in 597 BCE. Following the revolt of Jerusalem in 587-586 BCE, many residents were carried off to Babylon and kept there for several generations.\n\nBabylon during this period was perhaps the most impressive city in the world. The wealth of trade and empire was expended on monuments, ziggurats, and palaces. The giant walls and the Ishtar Gate were described in detail by Herodotus and listed as one of the wonders of the world. The famous Hanging Gardens were built to resemble a verdant mountain to remind Nebuchadnezzar's wife of her homeland. This status stood in vast contrast with the condition of the city during Assyrian rule.\n\nThe final Babylonian Empire lasted until 539 BCE. During that year, the people of Babylon surrendered their city without a fight to the great Persian king Cyrus II. They had grown tired of their incompetent ruler Nabonidus and were ready to accept the wise and capable Persian king. The Persian Empire would become one of the most powerful empires to have ever existed in the Middle East."

70410,"Kii Peninsula, 210 BCE\n\nThe Divine Emperor Qin Shi Huang dispatched you across the eastern seas to locate the elixir of life on Penglai Mountain and return it to him so that he may rule China for eternity. You are a rational person and know that you may find no elixir in the eastern lands; but you did not become court sorcerer by digging wells after you are thirsty.

70412,"After defeating the Jomon chieftain, you scaled the mountain and found no elixir. If you were to return to China, the Emperor would be most displeased with your failure. You decide to stay and settle in this land. The Jomon will need a leader and you have much to teach them."
70413,"After failing to defeat the Jomon, you made a hasty retreat to China without the elixir. The Emperor is most displeased with your failure. He orders you to report to his mausoleum to serve him for all eternity as one of the figures in his Terracotta Army."
70414,"Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of China, feared death and sought a way to achieve immortality. According to legends, he tasked Xu Fu, the court sorcerer and alchemist, with finding an elixir of life on the mythical Penglai Mountain in the islands east of China. According to Chinese accounts, Xu Fu landed on the Kii Peninsula of Japan, near Mount Fuji, in 210 BCE with a crew of soldiers, farmers, and craftsmen. Xu Fu never returned to China, however, presumably making himself king of the islands rather than return home empty-handed. Legends relate that Xu Fu, who became known as Jofuku in Japanese histories, taught the natives of the islands medicinal and farming techniques. He would eventually become one of the possible historical inspirations for the first Japanese emperor, Jimmu.\n\nWhile archaeological records cannot confirm these legendary events, beginning in 300 BCE, rice farmers from mainland Asia settled in the Japanese archipelago and introduced elements of Chinese culture and technology to the islands. The earlier inhabitants of Japan, whose culture is known as Jomon, were a Neolithic people who subsisted primarily through hunting, fishing, and gathering. They used basic stone and wooden tools and stitched together their clothing from the bark of the mulberry tree. The Jomon are best known for their patterned pottery, from which the culture gets its name. This earthenware is among the oldest pottery found in the world, with pieces dating to as early as 14,500 BCE.\n\nAround 300 BCE, the material culture of Japan became more sophisticated due to mainland influences. Over the next six centuries, a period known as the Yayoi period, Japan saw a technological revolution with the introduction of rice agriculture and metalworking. Chinese historical records from this period describe Japan as a land of hundreds of scattered tribal communities, often in conflict with one another."

70423,"You have failed, but do not worry. The elders say there are things other than dotaku bells they can bury to ensure successful harvests. They ask that you report to the fields."
70424,"The Yayoi period marked the change in Japanese society from one of hunter-gatherers to an agrarian and militarized society. Stone tools and weapons were replaced with those of bronze and iron, while rice farming encouraged the Japanese to settle in larger communities. The first powerful clans and the beginnings of a class system appeared, laying the foundations for the daimyo and samurai of later centuries.\n\nThe use of metal was not restricted to weapons and tools. The Yayoi were skilled blacksmiths, creating ceremonial bells known as dotaku. These bells were richly decorated with patterns and images representing nature and animals. They were used in agricultural rituals and as warning bells in case of attacks.\n\nChinese dynastic histories, which recount the activities of 'barbarian' neighbors, reference a great civil war in Japan during the late Yayoi period. The introduction of rice cultivation and metallurgy from the mainland had encouraged local leaders to extend their authority over other regions, particularly coastal villages, to control the flow of imports and mainland technologies. This conflict reduced the political fragmentation of the islands as a few powerful leaders expanded their territory at the expense of smaller and weaker chiefdoms."

70430,"Nara, 180 CE\n\nWar has raged over the islands for many years, and the spirits are angry. Their disharmony is felt in the trembles of the earth and the waves which fall over and sweep away the coastal villages.

You will send envoys to China to establish relations with the mighty Cao Wei kingdom. And when you finally breathe your last, your people will inter your remains in a great earthen mound built to honor your illustrious life."
70433,"Maybe becoming queen of Japan was a bit too ambitious, even for a shamaness. You might be better off using your magic on something more attainable. There are some sheep who could use a leader."
70434,"The introduction of rice agriculture in Japan had profound impacts on Japanese culture. Population increased tenfold from the earlier Jomon period and Yayoi sites featured large structures suggestive of grain storehouses. As in other parts of the world following the introduction of large-scale agriculture, these changes were followed by increased social stratification, tribal warfare, and the construction of military fortifications to defend grain stores and farming lands. \n\nChinese records from the 3rd century CE mention a kingdom called Yamataikoku, a possible precursor state to the later Yamato. According to these sources, the kingdom was ruled by Queen Himiko, a spiritual leader who ascended the throne as a young woman after the great civil war in the islands. It was said in the Chinese histories that Himiko used magic and her knowledge of the spirits to bewitch the people into placing her on the throne. As Queen, she established diplomatic relations with the Chinese kingdom of Cao Wei, famed for its role during the Three Kingdoms Period of Chinese history. Himiko remained unmarried during her long reign and resided in a grand palace with one thousand women and one man as attendants.\n\nUnlike the Chinese accounts, however, the Japanese chronicles are less certain of Himiko's existence, with the two oldest Japanese histories making no mention of the queen. In later centuries, Japanese writers would identify Himiko with other women, most notably Empress Jingū, another legendary figure who reigned as regent during the minority of her son, Homutawake, later known as the Emperor Ōjin."

70440,"Izumo-taisha, 300 CE\n\nIt has been many years since the reign of Queen Himiko and war once again grips Japan. Your clan, the Yamato, controls the Kansai region, where you, Homutawake, rule as king. Rival lords, however, threaten your rule in this life and the next. They compete with one another over farming lands and the construction of giant burial mounds to house their remains. But you know that the great Shinto shrines are more prized than any rice paddy or mound. Your rivals, the Izumo clan, control one such shrine. Destroy it and build a greater shrine where it once stood to weaken your rivals' influence, and receive the blessings of the gods.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy Izumo Âwiçtynia.\n• Build a Âwiçtynia where Izumo Âwiçtynia once stood."

70442,"The gods have blessed your reign, Emperor Homutawake. Your defeat of the Izumo and their Kibi allies has strengthened your clan, making the Yamato the predominant power on Honshu island. You have constructed shrines throughout your lands, and begun construction of a great burial mound to house your remains after your work on this earth is done."
70443,"Your sons counsel you on your failure. They recommend that you make peace with the gods by becoming a hermit. They say Mount Fuji is quite lovely in the winter."
70444,"Around 300 CE, large earthen burial mounds, called Kofun tombs, began appearing in Japan. These mounds varied in size and shape, but most distinctive were those resembling a giant keyhole pattern. Rulers and the elite were buried in the tombs with weapons and other personal items. As with the construction of monuments in other parts of the ancient world, the building of these tombs coincided with political centralization and a period of warfare during which various local chiefs competed for dominance.\n\nThe Shinto religion also emerged from previous belief systems during the Kofun period, although the oldest Shinto shrines, such as Izumo-taisha and Ise Grand Shrine, date to as early as the Yayoi period. The word Shinto, meaning \"way of the gods,\" was adopted from the Chinese Shendao, meaning \"spirit path or study.\" In Shinto religion, practitioners rely on diligent ritual to establish a connection to the Kami, or gods. The Kami embody the powers of nature such as the sun, wind, storms, and the sea."

70450,"Mount Shigi, 587 CE\n\nMuch has changed in the many generations since the Yamato clan rose to rule Japan. Now, the clan has been splintered into many and the old Shinto ways have been challenged by Buddhist missionaries from China. The Mononobe clan are opponents of the new faith and have held the ears of the Emperors for generations, but the Soga are gaining influence. The sudden death of your father, the Emperor, has opened the rifts in the Imperial court and the Mononobe now threaten civil war. In an affront to your Buddhist beliefs, they have seized relics of the Buddha.

70453,"Because of your failure, your enemies now control the Emperor and Japanese Buddhism is in decline. Better luck next life."
70454,"As the Yamato consolidated control of Japan, their name became synonymous with the island empire. Influenced by China, the Yamato developed a central administration and an imperial court.\n\nMany clans still aspired for power, however, and vied for influence over the Emperor. The Soga were one such family, occupying key positions in the Imperial court and marrying into the Imperial family. Devout Buddhists, the Soga found themselves in conflict with the rival Mononobe clan, who held conservative Shinto beliefs.\n\nThe sudden death of the Emperor Yōmei in 587 CE brought the tensions between the clans to open warfare. A son of the Emperor, and scion of the Soga clan, Prince Shōtoku led the pro-Soga armies against the Mononobe at Mount Shigi. According to legend, the young prince prayed for victory and was visited by Bishamonten, the Buddhist deity of war, who led him to victory. In recognition of this aid, the prince would go on to construct many Buddhist temples throughout Japan. Although he never became Emperor himself, Prince Shōtoku held substantial power as regent for his aunt, the figurehead Empress Suiko."

70460,"Asuka, 645 CE\n\nThe Soga must be stopped! Since the days of Prince Shōtoku, the clan has had its thumb on the Imperial family, but now, they have gone too far. They plan to depose your mother, the Empress, and put a more compliant puppet on the Imperial throne. Prince Naka no Ōe, you must defeat the Soga and finally drive them from power, but exercise caution. They control the Imperial capital, and you are not yet in a strong position to confront them. You may need to hide your intentions by offering the Soga gifts of peace until you are powerful enough to defeat them.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy Soga Centrum rzçdowe."

Though it will be many years before you ascend the throne as Emperor Tenji, your victory has assured that your uncle and mother will be secure in their reigns. Your uncle has already begun to institute reforms to increase Imperial power and reduce the influence of the clan heads. It is your hope that the Emperor of Japan will never again be a pawn of the clans."
70463,"The Soga find your attempt at keeping your mother in power cute. They call you \"mama's boy.\""
70464,"After defeating the Mononobe, the Soga clan heads were the powers behind the throne for the next few Emperors and Empresses. By 645 CE, Soga no Emishi and his son Soga no Iruka had begun to assert themselves more overtly in Imperial affairs. In response, a courtier named Nakatomi no Kamatari conspired with a junior member of the Soga clan and Prince Naka no Ōe, son of the reigning Empress Kōgyoku, to assassinate the Soga clan heads.\n\nKnown as the Isshi Incident, the assassination of Soga no Iruka took place during a court ceremony at which memorials were being read to the Empress. Prince Naka no Ōe had ordered four assassins to kill the Soga leader, but when they became too frightened to carry out the order, the prince himself rushed Iruka, killing him in front of the Empress. Shocked by the violence, Empress Kōgyoku abdicated and her brother ascended the throne as Emperor Kōtoku. Having heard of his son's death, Soga no Emishi committed suicide by self-immolation and the Soga clan passed into history.\n\nAlthough he only ruled for ten years, Emperor Kōtoku established significant reforms in Japanese political culture, with the support of his nephew Prince Naka no Ōe. Known as the Taika Reforms, these policies implemented in 645 CE centralized Imperial power, in imitation of Chinese political systems. Confucian ideas were introduced, and Japanese envoys and scholars were sent to China to learn and adopt many aspects of Chinese culture and religion.\n\nTen years after ascending the throne, Kōtoku died and his sister returned to rule Japan. On her death in 661 CE, Prince Naka no Ōe ascended the throne and took the name Emperor Tenji."

70470,"Ōtsu, 672 CE\n\nPrince Ōama, your elder brother, Emperor Tenji, has passed from this world. Though he was a great man, his final act was a grave mistake: he named a son of a lowborn wife as Emperor. This will ruin the authority and legitimacy of the Emperor as a descendant of gods on both family lines. What will the Chinese Emperor think of Japan now that it is ruled by a man of low birth? You have no choice, Prince Ōama. You must depose your nephew and take the Chrysanthemum Throne of Japan.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy Emperor Kōbun's Centrum rzçdowe.\n• Protect Asuka Centrum rzçdowe."

70472,"You have saved Imperial legitimacy by ascending the throne as Emperor Tenmu. You will continue the reforms of your uncle and brother, strengthening both Japan and the Imperial power. To achieve these goals, you have found a ready ally in the very clan that assisted your brother in defeating the Soga years ago: the Nakatomi, now bearing the honorific clan name Fujiwara. Surely, they will be loyal friends of the Emperor for generations."
70473,"Your nephew is most forgiving of your treachery. He has even given you a position in his court. Report to him to begin your duties as Court Eunuch."
70474,"After strengthening Imperial power, the Emperor Tenji resolved to designate an heir as he approached old age. His eldest son, Prince Ōtomo, was talented enough to succeed him, but the Emperor had sired him with a lowborn wife. This parentage and the lowly status of his maternal family would make Prince Ōtomo an unlikely heir to his father, as his political support was limited. Nevertheless, the Emperor decided that his son would succeed him and named him heir.\n\nThe Emperor did have a younger brother, Prince Ōama, who had the backing of some members of the Imperial court. The youngest son of Emperor Jomei and Empress Kōgyoku, Ōama's ancestry fulfilled expectations for an Emperor. In fact, until he decided on his son succeeding him, the Emperor Tenji had designated Ōama as crown prince.\n\nIn 670 CE, the Emperor fell ill and, fearing that Ōama would attempt to seize power, had his brother brought to him. The Emperor asked Ōama if he wished to succeed the throne. The prince stated he did not wish to become Emperor but would retire to a temple and become a monk. The Emperor was satisfied with this answer and Ōama retired to a temple.\n\nIn 672 CE, Emperor Tenji died and his son Ōtomo ascended the throne as Emperor Kōbun. Prince Ōama, despite his claim to his brother, had no intentions of giving up the chance to become Emperor and secretly raised an army. He then marched on the Emperor at his palace in Ōtsu. In the conflict, known as the Jinshin War, Ōama defeated his nephew, who committed seppuku (ritual suicide), and ascended the throne as Emperor Tenmu."

70480,"Kyushu, 740 CE\n\nEmperor Shōmu, your great-grandfather, the Emperor Tenji, ended the power of the Soga clan by aligning with a minor courtier. In recognition of his aid, your ancestor bestowed the clan name Fujiwara to the courtier.

You hope that with your victory and the weakening of the most powerful clan, you will be able to one day abdicate the throne in favor of your daughter. You will retire to a Buddhist temple to become a monk and walk the Eightfold Path. After all, with your victory, most assuredly, no clan will ever again dare to challenge the Yamato Emperor!"
70483,"Though they defeated you, the Fujiwara are most gracious to you as Emperor. Although they exiled you, they did allow you to be the ruler of your new home… on the northernmost tip of Japan. Dress warmly."
70484,"The Fujiwara clan originated when Nakatomi no Kamatari was rewarded with that clan name by Emperor Tenji for his role in the Isshi Incident that ended Soga power. During the rule of Emperor Tenji and his successors, the Fujiwara increased in power and married into the Imperial family, just as the Soga had done. By the 730's CE, the clan monopolized power on the Council of State with four out of ten seats held by a Fujiwara clan member. In 735 CE, however, a devastating plague swept through Japan and led to the deaths of the leading Fujiwara officials. This setback allowed other clans to gain prominence. These clans quickly pushed the Fujiwara out of power, causing Fujiwara officials to be demoted and sent to remote posts.\n\nFujiwara no Hirotsugu was one such official. He had been demoted from governor of Yamato province to a remote post at Dazaifu in Kyushu in 738 CE. In September 740 CE, Hirotsugu began a rebellion, demanding the dismissal of corrupt officials he blamed for his clan's decline.\n\nHirotsugu found willing followers in Kyushu. The island had suffered from the plague and repeated years of bad harvests. Government attempts to assuage the gods by constructing temples only exacerbated the conditions of the locals who were forced into providing labor for the building programs. Hirotsugu was soon able to raise an army and began establishing relations with the Korean Kingdom of Silla.\n\nThe Emperor Shōmu responded to these actions by sending an army to Kyushu. Hirotsugu's rebellion fell apart as several of his allies defected, and the Imperial forces distributed a decree promising rewards for the death of the rebel leader. Hirotsugu led his remaining forces to battle at the Itabitsu River, where they were decisively defeated. Hirotsugu then attempted to flee to Silla by boat, but storms caused him to abort his journey, and he was finally captured and beheaded."

In its place, I sowed weeds and cursed the site that whosoever raises the city of the Hattians again may the storm god smite him!"
70513,"You have been defeated by the Hattians and are unable to expand into their lands. Forced to live on the edges of civilization, your people despair. Now, your own warriors have selected leaders among themselves to depose you and your family. They will make sure you provide a new clean skull for the Hattians to decorate."
70514,"Anatolia, in modern-day Turkey, was home to some of the earliest urban settlements, including the proto-city Çatalhöyük, which flourished around 7000 BCE. Around 2500 BCE, the people known as the Hattians established their capital at Hattusa. The Hattians had trade relations with the Mesopotamian civilizations, and merchants from Assur in Assyria even established a trading post in the Hattic capital. These business dealings encouraged the Hattians to adopt the cuneiform writing script of their southern trade partners. The wealth of the region and the Hattic trade networks encouraged foreign invasions, but the Hattians were able to resist the armies of both the great Sargon of Akkad and his grandson, Naram-sin.\n\nThe Hittites emerge in the historical record around 2000 BCE. Their origins are disputed by historians, but they possessed a culture and language distinct from those of the previous peoples inhabiting Anatolia, including the Hattians. The Hittites quickly became the dominant power in the region. According to a set of Hittite tablets, known as the Anitta text (circa 1700 BCE), the Hittite king of a land called Kussara defeated the Hattian King Piyusti at Hattusa by storming the city at night. The Hittite king destroyed the city and cursed the site. Nevertheless, a later Hittite king would rebuild and repopulate the old Hattic capital, even taking the name Hattusili, meaning \"One from Hattusa.\""

70522,"The scribe tells of your victory: Mursili, King of Hattusa, anointed priest of the storm god Tarhunna, steward of the Sun God, overlord of the earth, marched on Babylon, on the road no king had ever taken, and defeated the lords of Babylon of number no less than fifty, and took captives numbering no less than two thousand. He carried off to Hattusa oxen, ingots of bronze and copper, and the god Marduk of Babylon. Of the oxen, he made sacrifices to the gods who were pleased with his devotions."
70523,"The storm god is displeased with your failure. The old clan rivalries have returned, and Hattusa is in anarchy. Your reign will mark the end of your people's history, but you will be remembered. Your name will become the word for \"worthless.\""
70524,"The founding of the Hittite kingdom and the establishment of the capital at Hattusa is credited to Hattusili I who also campaigned as far as the Semitic Amorite kingdoms of Syria. Hattusili was succeeded by his grandson, Mursili, who continued his grandfather's conquests. In 1595 BCE, Mursili conducted a great raid down the Euphrates River to Babylon, some 1500 miles from Hattusa. The Hittites sacked Babylon and deposed King Samsu-ditana, ending the Amorite dynasty of the city—a dynasty which had included among its members, the famed Hammurabi. As abruptly as they came, the Hittites left Babylon, carrying off the riches of the city, including statues of the city's patron god Marduk. Babylon was then taken by the Kassites, perhaps allies of Mursili, who established a dynasty which would last for four centuries.\n\nMursili's motivations for a raid so far beyond his territory and for his abrupt departure from the city are unknown. Some historians theorize that the recent eruption of the volcano Thera in the Eastern Mediterranean caused climatic changes which affected Hittite grain production. Therefore, the raid was an attempt to procure foodstuffs for a hungry population.\n\nKing Mursili did not long survive the raid. The lengthy campaign had so strained the resources of Hattusa that the Hittite king returned to a capital in turmoil. Mursili was assassinated by his brother-in-law, Hantili, at the urging of Hantili's son-in-law, Zidanta, an act which Hantili would eventually come to regret, according to the Hittite records. Hantili would rule the Hittites for some 30 years. On Hantili's death, Zidanta murdered the legitimate heir as well as all the heir's children and servants, to become king. Zidanta himself would be killed by his own son, who seized the throne. This instability began a century-long period of historical obscurity for the Hittites as the kingdom was plagued by weak kings and foreign invaders."

In retaliation, you have raised the call to war among your allies. The kings and princes of nineteen lands, among them Lukka, Ugarit, and Carchemish, join you in battle.

70533,"Your pathetic army has been crushed by the Egyptians, and soon hordes of their troops are flooding your cities, slaughtering your subjects at will. As worthless as your people were while following your orders, the innovative Egyptians have managed to find a use for them—their corpses have been transported to the fields where they will make excellent fertilizer."
70534,"By the 13th century BCE, the Near East had become a conflict zone between three major powers: the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Hittites, each vying for control and influence over the smaller Semitic and Hurrian kingdoms and cities of northern Mesopotamia, Syria, Lebanon, and Canaan. These small polities on the borders of the three great powers found themselves in a web of shifting alliances—with both one another and the great powers.\n\nOne such kingdom was Amurru in Syria. Amurru had been taken by the Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I during his campaigns in Canaan. At some point, however, Amurru shifted allegiance to the Hittites. In 1274 BCE, the Pharaoh Ramesses II captured the city, against Hittite protestations, escalating tensions between the two great powers. The Hittite King Muwatalli II mustered his allies to fight the Egyptians. He planned to meet the army of Ramesses at the city of Kadesh, an important trade center held by the Hittites.\n\nAccording to the Egyptian records, Ramesses, in haste to engage the enemy, drove his division ahead of the rest of his army. Believing the reports of two captured Shasu nomads, who claimed that the Hittite army was still far from Kadesh, the pharaoh was unprepared for a Hittite attack. In fact, Muwatalli's forces were nearby and, crossing the Arantu (Orontes) River, they ambushed the pharaoh and his smaller force.\n\nIn the initial clash, the Hittites had the advantage, catching the Egyptian Re Division—each unit in Ramesses' army was named after a god—in the open and routing it. The pharaoh himself became surrounded in the fighting and, according to his accounts, survived only by finding that the god \"Ammon's grace is better far to me than a million fighting men and ten thousand chariots be.\" The pharaoh personally led several charges into the Hittite ranks with his personal guard.\n\nThe Hittites, meanwhile, believing that they had defeated their enemies, stopped to plunder the Egyptian camp. This proved disastrous for the Hittites, who succumbed to an Egyptian counterattack from the Ptah division, which had arrived in time to prevent total defeat. As the Hittite army fled back across the river, the larger and heavier Hittite chariots, which carried three men, were overtaken and dispatched by the lighter and faster Egyptian chariots. Despite this rout, Muwatalli chose not to commit his reserves to the battle, instead keeping them in the city of Kadesh.\n\nThere is no historical consensus on the outcome of the battle. The surviving records from both civilizations claimed a great victory. The city of Kadesh remained under Hittite control, however, and Ramesses retreated to Egypt. The Egyptian pharaoh would return to Canaan in the following years and skirmish with the Hittites, but neither power could decisively defeat the other. Sixteen years after the clash at Kadesh, the two kingdoms signed a peace accord known as the Eternal Treaty. Remarkably, it is the only ancient treaty from the Near East in which each side’s version survived the ravages of time. Discovered nearly a century apart by archaeologists, the Hittite version of the alliance (recorded on clay tablets in Akkadian), and the Egyptian version (carved with hieroglyphics into stone) serve as an inspiration for modern nations."

70714,"Although the Romans credited their city's founding to Romulus in 753 BCE, Latin villages existed on the seven hills beside the Tiber River as far back as the end of the 14th century BCE. The city was formed gradually through the joining of these villages into a city-state ruled by a king, and sometimes under the domination of the nearby, more sophisticated Etruscans.\n\nCentral Italy in this period was inhabited by a diverse collection of peoples. The mysterious Etruscans, whose origins are lost in prehistory and who spoke a language unlike the others in Italy, were the preeminent pre-Roman Italian power. Culturally, the Etruscans were influenced by Greece and Phoenicia and were formed into a league of twelve cities for economic and religious cooperation. Various Italic peoples, including the Samnites, Umbrians, and Campanians, formed settlements, raided, and traded in Central Italy, while two sets of foreign invaders exerted influence in the north and south of the Italian peninsula. The Celtic Gauls entered Italy from the north and would even sack Rome in 390 BCE while Greek colonists established trade and farming settlements in Sicily and Southern Italy beginning in the 8th century BCE.\n\nIn 509 BCE, the Romans deposed King Lucius Tarquinius and established a Republic dominated by a patrician aristocracy. By the end of the 3rd century BCE, a series of successful wars against the Etruscans, Samnites, and the other Italian peoples culminated in Rome's domination of Central Italy from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic Seas."

70720,"Southern Italy, 280 to 272 BCE\n\nRoman conquests of the tribes of Central Italy have bred fear among the Greek colonists to the south. To their rescue comes a Macedonian, King Pyrrhus of Epirus, who lands in Italy with a mighty army including war elephants captured in the East. If Rome were to lose to the ambitious Pyrrhus, her southern expansion would be halted. If Pyrrhus can be defeated, however, Rome's victory would awaken the world to her growing power. The Senate is sending you, Consul, to meet these Greeks in battle and show them that their fears are well-deserved. For the first time, foreign men will know the fearsome might of Rome!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Macedonians without losing your two Centrum miasta."
70721,"1. The Army of Pyrrhus is more technologically advanced than you. A defensive approach to build up your forces is advised.\n2. You may need to expand northward to secure more gold resources.\n3. Pyrrhus' units move slowly. Attacking on two fronts could draw them in one direction, allowing you to concentrate your forces on a weaker front."
70722,"Against Pyrrhus' war elephants and well-trained phalanxes, the Romans suffered initial setbacks. In time, however, the legions of Rome triumphed, driving the Macedonians from Italy and opening the door for expansion into the south of the peninsula and the island of Sicily. All of Rome salutes you, Consul!"
70723,"The Macedonian phalanxes have decimated our swordsmen and King Pyrrhus has made a mockery of you as a war leader. Our gains to the south have been lost and the Macedonians threaten Rome itself. The leaders of Rome request that you report to the Strzelnica, where you will get the point of their dissatisfaction."
70724,"Roman expansion drew the attention of King Pyrrhus, the ambitious ruler of the Greek kingdom of Epirus on the northwest coast of Greece. Landing at Tarentum (Taranto) in 280 BCE, he defeated Roman armies at the battles of Heraclea (280 BCE) and Asculum (279 BCE). The heavy losses his army sustained in these victories, however, led Pyrrhus to famously despair, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\"; this was the origin of the expression \"a Pyrrhic victory\", meaning a success at a prohibitively high price. These battles against Pyrrhus were the Romans' first experience fighting Greek-style phalanxes and armies using war elephants.\n\nPyrrhus' success against the Romans encouraged the Greeks of Sicily to request his aid in their war against another rising power: the Carthaginians of North Africa. Pyrrhus defeated the Carthaginians and briefly came to rule the island. His harsh rule, however, invited hostility from the Sicilians and he was forced to abandon the island, foreshadowing to his companions that he was leaving a \"wrestling ground\" to the Carthaginians and Romans. Returning to Italy, Pyrrhus found himself outnumbered against the Roman army at the battle of Beneventum (Benevento) in 275 BCE and returned to Greece.\n\nWithout Pyrrhus to protect them, the Greek colonies in Southern Italy were absorbed by the Roman Republic, which turned her attention to the city of Syracuse on the island of Sicily."

70730,"Syracuse, 214 to 212 BCE\n\nRoman power is threatened. The Carthaginian general Hannibal has crossed the Alps into Italy. His successes have incited factions in Syracuse to break the city's long-standing alliance with Rome—an alliance formed with the defeat of Pyrrhus. Though no general of Syracuse compares to Hannibal, take care when besieging that wealthy city. The great engineer and inventor Archimedes has constructed wondrous methods of defense against both land and sea attacks. Although he is an advisor to Rome's enemies, he must be captured alive. Take Syracuse but preserve the life of Archimedes, as he will be useful to us.\n\nCele:\n• Place 10 Roman Legionista units in the Syracuse forum (raised area marked by two yellow flags).\n• Do not kill Archimedes (Kapîan)."
70731,"1. Beware Archimedes' powerful towers. If you must face them, attack them in great numbers.\n2. Use Katapultas only when necessary as the area of effect damage of their stones could accidentally kill Archimedes."
70732,"The victory over Syracuse reminds the Greeks of Sicily that Rome will punish treachery. Hannibal's efforts to spread rebellion have failed and his rampage through Italy has been slowed. Now, spies tell the Senate that Hannibal has called for reinforcements."
70733,"Your failure to retake Syracuse and the heavy losses you have sustained have infuriated the leaders of Rome. More of our old foes have been inspired to join the Carthaginians in this war. Our list of enemies grows daily. The next time you encounter a Carthaginian Sîoé bojowy, we suggest you kick it in a sensitive spot and take your medicine."
70734,"Following Rome's victory over Pyrrhus, the growing Republic continued its southward expansion, seizing control of Southern Italy. Roman designs on the island of Sicily, settled by Greek colonists, brought the Republic into conflict with Carthage, a maritime power based on the coast of modern-day Tunisia. In the ensuing First Punic War (264 – 241 BCE), Rome was victorious, seizing control of Sicily save for Rome's ally, the city of Syracuse, and emerging as the preeminent land and naval power in the central Mediterranean.\n\nCarthage would attempt to reassert herself during the Second Punic War (218 – 202 BCE). The general Hannibal led an army from Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal), across both Gaul and the Alps, to invade Italy. Hannibal was immensely successful, destroying multiple Roman armies sent against him, but lacked the siege equipment to take the city of Rome itself. Nevertheless, his successes encouraged many southern cities with primarily Greek and Italic populations to defect from Roman rule.\n\nAlthough Syracuse had been a long-time Roman ally during the reign of King Hiero II, a former general of Pyrrhus, his teenage grandson and successor, Hieronymus, held no such loyalties. Though Hieronymus was soon assassinated in a coup, the pro-Carthaginian factions within Syracuse had decided the city's fate—Rome sent a fleet forth to take Syracuse.\n\nThe famed inventor, engineer, and mathematician Archimedes lived in Syracuse and aided the city's defense. Legends tell that he constructed hexagonal mirrors that focused the sun's rays to set alight Roman ships, and great swinging claws that could lift ships out of the water by their rams and drop them back to the water, smashed like toys. Against these devices and the natural defenses of the Sicilian shore, the Romans were bogged down into a lengthy siege, but were ultimately victorious.\n\nAlthough the Roman commander, Marcus Marcellus, had ordered that Archimedes be spared, the great inventor would not survive the battle. As the Romans took the city, Archimedes retired to his studies but was disturbed by a Roman soldier. Archimedes protested the interruption and commanded the soldier to leave. The nameless Roman soldier, perhaps unaware of the man's identity, killed Archimedes. The Roman writer Plutarch tells us that Marcellus was greatly distressed when he learned of the pointless death of the Greek genius—one of the greatest minds the world had ever known."

70740,"Metaurus River, 208 to 207 BCE\n\nHannibal is at the gates! Though the Carthaginian general and his savage mercenaries lack the strength to take Rome itself, they have set the Italian countryside aflame and have defeated every legion sent against them for the past ten years. Now, spies tell us that Hannibal has sought out his brother, Hasdrubal, who has slipped our grasps in Hispania and crossed the Alps just as Hannibal did a decade ago. If Hasdrubal's army is allowed to join Hannibal's, Rome would surely fall to the barbarous Carthaginians! Go now, Consul of Rome, divide our enemies and conquer them!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the two Carthaginian forces, or build a Cud that stands."
70741,"1. Friendly Roman villages lie beyond the rivers. They will help you if you find them.\n2. Hannibal has a foothold to the east. An aggressive strike against this base will give you additional space and access to more resources.\n3. Shallows are important strategic positions to hold."
70742,"Your victory at the Metaurus River has given hope to all Romans, long terrorized by the dark specter of Hannibal. With the Carthaginian general stalemated in Italy, our legions march against our enemies in far-off Hispania. Led by Publius Scipio, a son of the storied Dom Cornelius, the legions have defeated Carthage's allies, the Iberian tribes. The promising young general is not satisfied by these triumphs—he has designs on Africa and Carthage herself."
70743,"Your failure has condemned Rome. Bolstered by Hasdrubal's army, Hannibal marches on our capital. Our Republic is on its death throes. The Senate requires that you strap yourself to the ram of a trireme and put your thick skull to good use."
70744,"Despite successive victories over the Romans early in his Italian campaign, Hannibal lacked the siege equipment and manpower to take Rome itself and end the war. The defeat of Carthage's ally, Syracuse, in 212 BCE and Carthaginian reverses and stalemates at Tarentum, Capua, and Beneventum in Southern Italy the same year, weakened Hannibal's position and whittled down his forces, made up primarily of Iberian, Gallic, and Numidian mercenaries. A rival political faction in Carthage, led by Hanno II the Great, had opposed the war from the start and refused to provide support to what was viewed as the personal vendetta of an overly ambitious Hannibal. What support the Carthaginian leadership provided to the war effort was sent to Iberia, where Carthage had significant commercial interests.\n\nFortunately for Hannibal, his brother Hasdrubal was committed to the war against Rome. In 207 BCE, Hasdrubal marched a fresh army from Iberia and across the Alps just as Hannibal had done a decade prior. The two brothers hoped that their combined armies would be sufficient to conquer Rome.\n\nWhile Hannibal fought the Roman consul Claudius Nero at Grumentum in Southern Italy, Hasdrubal crossed the Metaurus River hundreds of miles to the north and approached the legions of the second consul, Marcus Livius Salinator. Hasdrubal sent messengers to his brother with his plans, but these were captured en route by Claudius Nero. Realizing the danger that the union of the two armies would pose, Nero took a detachment of his army and rapidly marched north, reaching Livius' camp at night.\n\nThe following morning, as the Roman and Carthaginian armies deployed for battle, Hasdrubal realized that the Roman army had swelled overnight. Suspecting that he was now facing two armies, Hasdrubal retired to his fortifications. That night, Hasdrubal led his army out of camp in an effort to cross the river and retreat to a more advantageous position. Perhaps betrayed by his guides, the Carthaginian general searched futilely for a ford across the Metaurus. The next morning, with the backs of the Carthaginians against the river, the Romans attacked. Hasdrubal was killed and his army annihilated. In an infamous act, Claudius Nero had Hasdrubal's severed head taken south and thrown into Hannibal's camp."

70750,"Zama, 202 BCE\n\nPublius Scipio, your unrelenting victories over Carthage's allies have brought you renown, but greater triumphs await! With Hispania and her Iberian tribes subdued by your legions, you ventured across the sea to the hot sands of Africa to threaten Carthage herself. Your gamble has succeeded—Hannibal has abandoned his Italian campaign to rush to the defense of his homeland. The Carthaginians are numerous and will fight with the determination of men defending their homes, but you have yet another gambit in play. King Massinissa of the Numidian desert tribes has betrayed Hannibal and bolsters your auxiliaries with his horsemen. Defeat Hannibal on the battlefield of Zama and Carthage will finally know the price of defying Rome!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the three Docks in Carthage's harbor\n• Bring Scipio to the blue flags at Carthage's Byrsa Forum"
70751,"1. Reaching the Numidian camps will provide you with Ciỳêki konny îuczniks.\n2. Hannibal relies on resources gathered west of Carthage. Destroying his camps there will eventually starve him of resources needed to train his armies.\n3. A group of Priests can turn the tide of any battle against War Elephants and Phalanxes."
70752,"Hannibal has been defeated and the leaders of Carthage beg Rome for peace and forgiveness. To mark your great victory at Zama, the Senate has bestowed the name Africanus upon you. Rome will soon turn her gaze to the north and the east for new victories, but for now, all of Rome celebrates your triumph, Scipio Africanus!"
70753,"Your defeat at the battle of Zama disappoints Rome. The Carthaginians are rejuvenated and more dangerous than ever. Hannibal has outfitted another army to invade Italy, and the Senate fears that many more Romans will die in a losing war. The leaders of Rome require that you report to Katapulta Unit XIV where you will be given another opportunity to have an impact on the Carthaginians."
70754,"Publius Cornelius Scipio began his military career with the daring rescue of his father, the commander of the Roman army defeated by Hannibal at the Battle of Ticinus (218 BCE). The younger Scipio, seeing his father surrounded by enemy troops, drove his horse into the enemy ranks, opening a path through to the commander.\n\nIn 211 BCE, Scipio's father and uncle were killed in battle against Hasdrubal, Hannibal's brother, in Iberia—known to the Romans as Hispania. The Roman Senate held an election for the commander of the new army to be sent to Hispania. Scipio was the only man with the courage to volunteer for what was viewed as a death sentence. In command of fresh legions, he landed at the mouth of the Ebro River and was able to surprise and capture Carthago Nova, the Carthaginian capital in the region.\n\nIn Hispania, Scipio was renowned for his humanitarian treatment of prisoners. The Roman historian Livy writes that the Roman troops captured a beautiful local woman and offered her to their commander as a war prize. Scipio discovered the woman was betrothed to a local chieftain and had her returned to her fiancé, along with the money that had been offered as a ransom. In return, the chieftain pledged his warriors to support Scipio. Such humanitarian acts helped portray Rome as liberators instead of conquerors and encouraged local chieftains to supply and reinforce the Roman army.\n\nAfter successfully occupying Hispania, Scipio returned to Rome intending to go to Africa and bring the war to Carthaginian lands. Senate leadership, however, grew envious of Scipio and suspicious of his intentions. The Senate refused to support Scipio with additional troops beyond a small garrison in Sicily, a posting usually reserved for the disgraced survivors of Roman defeats. The general trained these men thoroughly and forged an alliance with King Massinissa, ruler of the Berber Numidian kingdom in North Africa and one-time ally of Carthage. With no more support from the Senate beyond permission to sail to Africa, Scipio departed.\n\nThe appearance of a Roman army near Carthage caused Hannibal to abandon his Italian campaign. Returning to Africa, Hannibal's army met Scipio's forces on the plain of Zama, near Carthage. In the ensuing battle, Hannibal sent his elephants to charge the Roman lines, but Scipio had prepared for them. He ordered his cavalry to blow loud trumpets which panicked the elephants. He also had his men open gaps in their battle line, suspecting that the elephants would be lured through, allowing them to be cut down from the sides. These tactics worked, neutralizing Hannibal's advantage. Scipio then sent his legions forward against the Carthaginian lines. After a furious battle, Scipio was victorious and agreed to moderate peace terms with the Carthaginians, to the anger of Senators in Rome who preferred harsher penalties on their enemy. Scipio returned to Rome and was honored with the name Africanus, commemorating his victory in Africa."

70760,"Greece and Pontus, 89 to 63 BCE\n\nMithridates, the cunning King of Pontus, has expanded his kingdom on the Black Sea coast at the expense of Rome's allies in Anatolia. Claiming descent from both Alexander and the Persian King Cyrus the Great, he has incited the Greeks and Easterners to rebel against our interests, and has even forged an alliance with the mighty Tigranes, King of Artaxiad Armenia. The Senate is dispatching you with the legions to restore our eastern domains and humble this so-called King of Kings.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Cud of Pontus."
70761,"1. Weaken the defenses of your enemy by sea to establish a safe landing ground.\n2. Concentrate solely on the mission; complete conquest is unlikely."
70762,"Your victory over Mithridates and his allies has recovered our eastern provinces and restored peace. We now control most of the Mediterranean coastline, although the sea itself is still rife with pirates who resist Roman rule. With Greece and the East pacified, Rome can now turn to clearing the sea of these pirates and make the Mediterranean a truly Roman lake."
70763,"All of Greece is warring against us now and our provinces in Asia are long gone. Rome's losses are incalculable. Thanks to your ineptitude, Mithridates looks like a modern Alexander the Great. You, however, have fallen significantly short of that mark. Report to the arena for duty poking starved tigers with small sticks."
70764,"Pontus was a Persian kingdom based on the Black Sea coast of northeast Anatolia and heavily influenced by the Hellenic culture predominant in the Near East following Alexander's conquests. Founded by Mithridates I in 281 BCE, the kingdom saw its greatest extent under Mithridates VI the Great, who conquered most of the Anatolian peninsula and nearly the entire Black Sea coastline. The ambitious Mithridates VI was a rival and opponent of Rome throughout his reign, fighting three distinct wars, known as the Mithridatic Wars, against the Romans from 89 BCE to 63 BCE.\n\nPortraying himself as a successor to both Alexander and the Persian King Cyrus the Great, Mithridates leveraged otherwise disparate cultural heritages to his advantage, uniting both Greek cities and eastern kingdoms such as Armenia in opposition to Roman rule and eastward expansion. In the First Mithridatic War, Mithridates was defeated in Greece by the armies of the Roman consul Sulla. Sulla offered the Pontic king moderate peace terms as the consul was embroiled in a conflict with his rival, Marius, for control of Rome and was eager to return to the city with his legions. These moderate terms allowed Mithridates to rearm and re-equip his military. The official Sulla left behind, Licinius Murena, invaded Pontus soon after to hinder the kingdom's militarization efforts, igniting the Second Mithridatic War, but peace was soon restored on Sulla's order.\n\nA decade later, Rome attempted to annex the client kingdom of Bithynia in Anatolia. Mithridates attacked, beginning the Third Mithridatic War. The Roman general Pompey defeated Mithridates, forcing the king to flee with his surviving army past the Caucasus Mountains to the Crimea, on the north coast of the Black Sea, where his son Machares ruled as viceroy. After Machares refused to aid his father with troops, Mithridates had him killed and took control of his son's realm. In 63 BCE, another son, Pharnaces, led a coup against his father. Mithridates withdrew to his citadel, where his attempt at suicide by poisoning is said to have failed due to his habit of taking daily precautionary antidotes. Whether this story is true or not, Mithridates did not survive his son's coup.\n\nPompey, meanwhile, fresh off his victory over Pontus, led his armies into Syria and Judea, where he captured Jerusalem and made the Jewish kingdom a satellite state of Rome."

70810,"Asia Minor, 75 BCE\n\nOh, the rumors when the rich families in Rome heard that the young Caesar of the Julii Family had been captured by Cilician pirates. Thank the gods that you are free now. I had hoped to dissuade you from raising a fleet and attacking the pirates to exact your vengeance, instead of returning to Rome and your family. But I see you have made up your mind and, knowing your late father, I recognize this stubbornness runs in the family. So, set sail, young Caesar, and redeem your family name once and for all.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy all enemy Docks.\n• If Caesar dies, the mission will be lost."
70811,"1. Opposition will become stronger as you sail farther from Roman territory.\n2. Certain Docks are easier to destroy by attacking from land."
70812,"The expedition against your kidnappers has boosted your reputation among the Roman elite and has shown you to be a man of your word. People will think twice before taking action against you, and several senators have asked for your friendship. Two mighty men, Pompey and Crassus, have even asked you to join them in a triumvirate and rule over Rome together. Soon, you will be one of the most important men in the whole Republic."
70813,"The pirates have made a mockery of your boast to return and eradicate them. Rome is disappointed, but because you paid for the expedition personally there will be no recriminations. The job of eliminating the pirates has been given to a real man, Pompey. You can go along to keep his torso armor oiled."
70814,"Caesar was born into an aristocratic family, the Julii, which was not very influential despite a long heritage and strong marital ties. During his early life, Caesar witnessed the civil war between Sulla and Gaius Marius, which tore up the Roman Republic. Both men were distinguished commanders who were set on becoming dictators, one belonging to the optimates and the other one to the populares, two rival political parties in Rome. It is said that Caesar drew inspiration from Marius' march on Rome when he crossed the Rubicon later in his life. During the power struggle between Sulla and Gaius Marius, Caesar himself became a victim of the political turmoil. Sulla wanted to get rid of Caesar due to his family ties to his rival, and so Caesar was stripped of his inheritance, his wealth, and his priesthood, and had to go into hiding. However, his mother's family, who had members close to Sulla, managed to persuade the latter to let Caesar return. Sulla reluctantly gave in, saying that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.\n\nFearing that Sulla might change his mind, Caesar left Rome and went into military service, where he distinguished himself with his bravery and leadership capabilities. When, in 79 BCE, Sulla resigned his dictatorship and retired, it was safe for Caesar to return to Rome. However, having the ambition to become a great politician, he soon left Italy again for Greece to study rhetoric.\n\nDuring one of his travels east, Caesar was kidnapped by Cilician pirates and held hostage at their secret hideout. During his captivity, Caesar maintained an attitude of superiority, and his arrogance both surprised and entertained the pirates. When they wanted to ransom Caesar for 20 talents he demanded that they ask for 50 talents because he was worth at least that much; and when he spent time reading his poems to them, he called them barbarians for not appreciating them. Several times, he told the pirates that as soon as he was released he would return and have them all crucified, to which they responded with laughter. However, Caesar was true to his word. He raised a fleet and returned, capturing the pirates. Caesar brought them to the Roman governor of Asia, who refused to execute them as Caesar demanded because he would rather sell them as slaves. Caesar then took matters in his own hands and had them crucified.\n\nUpon his return to Rome, Caesar was elected military tribune, the first step on the political ladder. It still took him several years, but finally he became one of most powerful men in Rome and gained the Consulship in 59 BCE due to his conquests in Hispania while serving as its governor. Following these successes, he was made a member of the Triumvirate, an informal association with Pompey and Crassus. The three leaders vied with each other for control of Rome while dividing responsibility for the rest of the Republic. Caesar's governing responsibilities drew him into a series of campaigns in Gaul (modern France), Germania, and Britannia."

70820,"Britannia, 55 to 54 BCE\n\nJulius Caesar, you have been governor of Roman Gaul for 8 years and have fought a series of brilliant campaigns against the many enemies of Rome. You correctly determined that you had to bring Gaul under Roman control to gain popularity in Rome and extend your power. Now, with the Gauls subdued and the German invaders expelled, you look north and west across the sea into Britain, a land clouded in mystery and surrounded by many strange legends. It is clear that the Britons assisted the Veneti during their war with you in Gaul, and so a punitive expedition is in order. It is unclear what lies beyond the misty waters and tall, white cliffs, but rumors of ancient tribes using chariots and fanatical druids conducting human sacrifices are beginning to spread among your troops.\n\nCele:\n• Capture and hold all the British centers of power (Ruins).\n• If Caesar dies, the mission will be lost."
70821,"1. Protect your siege weapons at all costs—their survival is vital to the success of your campaign.\n2. Do not waste time converting villagers; concentrate on the mission."
70822,"The Britons' admission to Rome secures the northern flank of Gaul. Although you did not conquer the island, the information on the terrain and the local tribes will ease the full-fledged subjugation of the British Isles by Rome… if that proves necessary. For now, it is back to the mainland. There are rumblings that tribal leaders in Gaul are fomenting a new rebellion."
70823,"Your invasion performed a basic reconnaissance of Britain, but your army has suffered heavy casualties that cannot be replaced easily. Your failure has triggered a crisis and the tribes of Gaul, having heard of your failures, have begun to rebel. The northern frontiers of Rome may soon be in flames. Report to the Senate where certain leaders want to take a stab at explaining where you went wrong."
70824,"After Caesar's consulship, the patricians, fearing Caesar's growing power, tried to limit his strength by allotting him useless lands in Italy instead of the governorship of a province that ex-consuls normally received. Caesar and his political allies, however, fought back and through political maneuvering managed to secure him not just one but three provinces. Two of these, Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul, bordered Celtic Gaul, a land still unconquered by the Romans. At the time of Caesar's governorship some of Rome's Gaulish allies had become nervous due to a new, massive migration by the Helvetii people, and asked for Rome's help. Caesar used this to his advantage, and raised several legions to march north to stop the Helvetii and prepare further campaigns into Gaul. Caesar's expedition was a success and Roman interests in the region seemed safe. However, a new threat loomed when Ariovistus, chieftain of the Suebi tribe, planned to invade Gaul with a large German army. Once again, Caesar had to march out to counter the menace that threatened Rome's allies, and again he succeeded, defeating the Suebi over the course of multiple battles.\n\nAlthough peace had been secured, Caesar continued his campaign, interfering further into Gaulish affairs. In 57 BCE, he marched against the Belgae up north and in 56 BCE against the Veneti in Armorica in the west, defeating them both. With Gaul firmly under Roman control, he then mounted an expedition against the Britons across the British Channel, suspecting that the Veneti had received support from the Celtic tribes in Britain. Caesar first sailed to Britain with two legions (around 10 thousand men) in 55 BCE, but had to fight his way ashore with help from catapults mounted on his ships due to heavy resistance. After three weeks of hard fighting, he agreed to a truce and returned to Gaul.\n\nThe following year, he invaded Britain again, but this time with five legions. Just as before, a large force of Britons assembled at the coast to contest the invasion. Seeing Caesar's large fleet and army, however, the Britons abandoned this strategy. Caesar and his armies then marched inland following the Thames River. The Britons avoided any major engagement and instead harassed the Romans, raiding the Roman camps at every opportunity. Another truce was arranged near modern-day St. Albans, and Caesar returned to Gaul after receiving the Britons' nominal submission.\n\nThe British Isles remained outside the Roman Empire until they were invaded again by the Romans under emperor Claudius in 43 CE. All of Britain south of Caledonia (modern-day Scotland), was conquered by 60 CE, and remained part of the Empire for nearly 350 years."

70830,"Alesia, 52 BCE\n\nJust when you think you have suppressed the Gauls in one place, they rise up in another. Despite our many campaigns, the Gauls seem determined to defy Roman rule. Even now, at Alesia, while we have surrounded their main army and leader, Vercingetorix, and are besieging their oppidum, they do not give up. Our messengers report that a gigantic Gallic army is approaching to relieve the siege of Alesia as we speak. With all of Gaul's warriors concentrated in one place, this battle will decide the fate of both Gaul and you, Caesar. Defeat the Gallic leader inside the settlement and we might just crush the spirit of the Gauls. Fail, and we will be overrun by the masses of Gallic warriors gathering outside of our encampment...\n\nCele:\n• Kill the Gallic leader, Vercingetorix.\n• If Caesar dies, the mission will be lost."
70831,"1. Our workers have been constructing a two-layered wall around the oppidum of Alesia, however Gaul reinforcements have already arrived. Complete the fortifications as quickly as possible.\n2. Avoid a multi-front siege from the enemy at all costs."
70832,"With the defeat of Vercingetorix and the Gauls, you have brought almost nine years of constant fighting to a close. All of Gaul has been added to the Roman Empire, and according to some sources millions of enemies have died in the process. The very name \"Caesar\" will become synonymous with leadership. Such success is not without its price, however. Jealous of your success and celebrity, and concerned about the size of our army, enemies in Rome have started to plot against you. On top of that, the Triumvirate with Crassus and Pompey has come to a sudden end when Crassus died in battle against the Parthians, which means it is once again each man for himself. With Western Europe at your feet, it is time to return home and deal with your old friend and former ally, Pompey."
70833,"Your failure to put down the revolt in Gaul means that all previous efforts to subdue Gaul were in vain and the Gauls are now united under the strong leadership of Vercingetorix. Having fled Gaul to the safety of the Roman provinces, you learned that a large combined army of Celts and Germans is now on the move to Rome, and so you must hurry back. Do not expect a pleasant reception, however, having exposed Rome to the barbarians like this. Report to the Tiber River for duty as a sandbag."
70834,"Unhappy with their subjugation by the Romans, the Arverni tribe, led by their chieftain Vercingetorix, revolted in 52 BCE and rallied many of the other tribes in central Gaul. Caesar, who at that time was raising troops in Cisalpine Gaul, was taken by surprise and had to march north to face yet another Gallic revolt. Vercingetorix's father had died trying to unite the Gauls under his sole rule, but Vercingetorix was more successful, imposing his authority over the tribes under him and uniting them against a common enemy. Knowing that the Gauls were unable to defeat the Romans in pitched battle, he adopted the policy of scorched earth in an attempt to deprive the Romans of supplies and support. At the battle of Gergovia, the Arvernian capital, Caesar suffered a major defeat which forced him to retreat. Luckily for him, however, in a following cavalry battle the Romans still managed to inflict heavy losses on Vercingetorix's army, causing him to withdraw to Alesia, a Gallic oppidum (fortified settlement).\n\nVercingetorix considered Alesia a safe haven, but Caesar followed him and started to besiege Alesia, trapping Vercingetorix and his army in 52 BCE. Caesar built fortifications to try to starve the Gauls, but Vercingetorix, seeing the danger he was in, sent scouts to all his Gallic allies, urging them to come and relieve the siege. The Gauls answered his call and a massive army of Gallic warriors marched towards Alesia. Hearing of what was unfolding, Caesar ordered his troops to build yet another line of fortifications, but this time on the outside of the Roman encampments. These fortifications were formidable, with high wooden walls, turrets, and stakes which could hold back the continuous attacks of the Gauls. After several failed attempts by the Gallic troops to relieve the siege, and with food running out in the fortress, Vercingetorix had no choice but to surrender, hoping that it would save the lives of the people in Alesia. Caesar accepted his surrender and took Vercingetorix captive. Five years later Caesar brought the conquered Gaul back to Rome to show him off during his triumphal march into the city. Immediately after the victory parade, Vercingetorix was strangled in his prison.\n\nWith the defeat of the Gallic army, the organized resistance of the Gauls came to an end, and Gaul came under strong Roman rule. It was a key addition to the Roman Empire for the next 500 years."

70840,"Pharsalus, 48 BCE\n\nAs expected, your bold move to cross the Rubicon into Italy has prompted a rebellion under the leadership of Pompey. The Republic has been hollowed out by civil wars and weak politicians, and so it is time for a strong man like yourself to bring Rome to its next phase. First, we must deal with the rebels. Pompey has fled to Greece after your quick successes in Italy. Having solidified your control in Rome and neutralized other Pompeian forces in Hispania, you have set sail to Greece to finish off Pompey. Your two armies will meet near the small city of Pharsalus to decide who will become the true ruler of Rome.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the forces of Pompey.\n• If Caesar dies, the mission will be lost."

70842,"Your decisive victory over Pompey solidifies your position as ruler of Rome. The entire Senate is forced to confirm you. You are remembered as the greatest of the Romans. Future emperors of Rome, Russia, and Germany will be called Caesar, Tsar, and Kaiser after you."
70843,"Your loss to Pompey elevates him officially to the post of dictator of Rome. You must flee and can only hope to find sanctuary in some forgotten corner of the world where you can live out your days dreaming of what might have been. Future emperors of Rome and a sauce for lettuces will be called Pompey, not Caesar."
70844,"When Crassus died in battle against the Parthians in 53 BCE, the triumvirate between the three most powerful men in Rome came to an end. Crassus, as the most wealthy and influential of the three, had always kept Caesar and Pompey in check, but with his death the two were left to compete for the control of Rome. It was understood that in the end only one of the two could stay in power as both men were unwilling to stand down.\n\nFearing Pompey and Caesar's unchecked power, senators in Rome demanded that both men hand over their armies and provinces to the republic. Pompey, who was in Rome, seemingly complied, promising to do so if Caesar did the same, but knowing well enough that his opponent would never comply. Thus, he managed to gain the support of the Senate. Caesar, who was just getting the news of the events unfolding in Rome, arrived on the borders of Italy with a very small force. Both the Senate and Pompey did not expect him to march on Rome since he had left most of his legions in Gaul, but they underestimated Caesar and the loyalty of his soldiers. Caesar, who was left no other choice than to Dowolnie invade Italy or to be stripped of all his legions and provinces, crossed the Rubicon, famously saying \"iacta alea est,\" meaning \"the die is cast.\" The senate hastily gathered an army of Italian veterans, but Caesar's quick and unexpected advances took his opponents by surprise. Rome's elite fled the city and Pompey was unable to gather enough men to resist Caesar due to the popularity of the latter in Italy. And so, Pompey was also forced to flee Italy for Greece, where he had more influence and power.\n\nThe senators who had remained in Rome hailed Caesar as the defender of Rome and made him dictator, the virtual monarch of Rome. After consolidating control of Italy and dealing with the allies of Pompey in Iberia, Caesar followed Pompey to Greece to deal with his rival.\n\nCaesar landed in Greece. Outnumbered by Pompey's army, he almost experienced a crushing defeat at the Battle of Dyrrachium in 48 BCE. Pompey suspected an ambush and did not pursue him, however, giving Caesar a chance to regroup. Then, at Pharsalus, Caesar finally managed to defeat Pompey decisively and make him again flee east, where some time later he was murdered by the Egyptian Pharaoh Ptolemy XII. However, the civil war did not end there, and hostilities continued for several years until Caesar was finally able to put all his opponents down. On March 15, 44 BCE, Caesar was assassinated in the Senate by conspirators that included politicians alarmed by the end of the Republic, former allies of Pompey, and disgruntled friends of Caesar himself."

70910,"Actium, 31 BCE\n\nMarc Antony has taken the offensive, crossing the Gulf of Ambracia in a maneuver designed to strike quickly at your camp. Cleopatra, meanwhile, has laid anchor within the gulf, her barge protected by the Egyptian navy. Should Antony's attack be repulsed, she will likely flee to Egypt where reinforcements await. Your destiny is in your hands, Octavian. Deal a crushing blow to your enemies here, and nobody will be able to challenge your claim to the title of Princeps Civitatis!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Centrum miasta of the two enemy fortresses.\n• Sink Cleopatra's Barge."

70912,"Your glorious victory over the combined forces of Antony and Cleopatra has compelled them to flee to Egypt. Although some additional maneuvers will doubtless be required to secure the lands that had rebelled under Antony, the main danger is past. You have solidified your control of Rome; and you are now positioned to take more power than any Roman ever has before. Soon, the citizens of Rome will be heaping endless praise on you during your triumph!"
70913,"Your loss to the combined forces of Antony and Cleopatra has compelled you to withdraw to Rome and attempt to rebuild your forces. With the eastern part of the empire now lost to our enemies, it is likely that Antony will follow up his victory by marching on Rome. A second defeat at the hands of Antony will mean the end of your career as consul and will surely allow Antony to become the first emperor of Rome."
70914,"Following the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, Rome was sent into a tailspin of conflict between various political factions. Out of the chaos emerged a triumvirate composed of Marc Antony (Caesar’s closest ally), Octavian (Caesar’s nephew), and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, the pontifex maximus of Rome. The power of this “Second Triumvirate” was derived from the Lex Titia, a piece of legislature that granted them near-absolute authority. At the Battle of Philippi in 42 BCE, they crushed the forces of Brutus and Cassius, two of the principal figures in the plot against Caesar.\n\nOctavian proved to be an exceptional politician, and was a master of brokering political alliances and utilizing the sentiments of the common people to support his own aims. For a decade, the volatile political alliance between the triumvirs was largely held together by mutual pragmatic interests and by Antony's marriage to Octavian's sister, Octavia. Antony was placed in control of the East while Octavian assumed control of the West. Lepidus’ role was increasingly marginalized.\n\nAntony committed a grave error when he fell for Cleopatra of Egypt and shunned his wife in favor of Cleopatra (in 33 BCE). Seizing the opportunity, Octavian leveraged this insult as a means of eroding Antony’s support from within the Senate and the people of Rome. The Senate agreed to declare war on Cleopatra, which was by extension a war on Antony. After some maneuvering, the forces of Octavian and Antony clashed at Actium, near the Gulf of Ambracia, in 31 BCE. Claiming a decisive victory, Octavian added most of the Roman territory in the East to his already impressive holdings.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra escaped to Egypt, where they attempted to recruit a new army. The local troops defected to Octavian, however, and Antony and Cleopatra chose to commit suicide rather than be paraded through the streets of Rome in Octavian’s triumph. Antony, true to Roman tradition, literally fell on his sword; but Cleopatra held a deadly poisonous snake—the asp—to her breast, causing it to bite her. Octavian, meanwhile, went on to further consolidate his power in Rome, first being proclaimed Princeps Civitatis (first citizen), and eventually becoming the first emperor of the newly-formed Roman Empire, which he ruled under the title of Augustus Caesar."

70920,"Italia, 69 CE\n\nThe brutal and likely insane Emperor Nero has died by his own hand, leaving no heir. Reveling in delusions of grandeur, a number of claimants to the throne have cast their lots forward. However, the soldiers under your command, Vespasian, are adamant in their belief that rule of the empire should be yours. Use your eastern legions to seize control of Rome while defending your flanks from the armies of the other usurpers.

70922,"Hail Caesar! Your outstanding victories in the field have made you the unquestioned heir to the throne in Rome. The people are tired of civil war and look forward to your enlightened rule. The duties of managing the Roman Empire are vast, and you will find yourself heavily burdened, but your legacy as a restorer of order and an effective administrator will live on for millennia. Fortune beckons you to further glory!"
70923,"The throne of Rome might have been yours if you had been as competent as many of your admirers had believed. Apparently, they grossly overestimated the extent of your skills. The new emperor holds no grudges, however. He commands that you report to the royal latrines, where he anticipates that your skillset will ensure that you are able to truly \"clean up.\""
70924,"The suicide of the Emperor Nero in 68 CE triggered a civil war between numerous claimants to the throne. During this chaotic year, four different men were recognized as emperor, if only temporarily. Galba, the legate in Hispania Tarraconensis, was elevated to the status of emperor and advanced on Rome, claiming the Empire as his own. He was extremely unpopular, however, due to a plurality of poor administrative decisions, chief among them his failure to pay the customary donative to the Praetorian Guard—the personal army of the Imperial household.\n\nSensing the ineffectuality of the emperor (who became so frail that he had to be carried on a litter), two more magnates advanced their claim. Marcus Salvius Otho bribed the Praetorian Guard to assassinate Galba and took his seat in the imperial palace, but soon discovered that he was quite unfit to govern. Meanwhile, Vitellius, commander of the legions of the Rhine and Gaul, advanced on Rome with his battle-hardened forces. After a defeat at Bedriacum, Otho committed suicide, ostensibly to spare the Empire from descending into civil war.\n\nVitellius entered Rome and was recognized as emperor by the Senate. However, several of the eastern provinces had thrown their support behind Vespasian, a capable commander with an extensive track record of military success, most recently having quashed a revolt in Judea. Under the command of Marcus Antonius Primus, Vespasian’s troops marched towards the Imperial City, winning a victory at Bedriacum, the same town where the Vitellians had defeated Otho’s army. Vitellius attempted to abdicate, but was slain along with his family. Shortly thereafter, Vespasian traveled to Rome, where his supreme power was cemented by the passing of a piece of legislation known as the Lex de Imperio Vespasiani."

70930,"Mesopotamia, 262 CE\n\nAfter a century of decline and relative dormancy, Persia has revived as a world power. The ineffectual Parthian state has been overthrown by the Dom of Sasan, which has formed a new dynasty and swiftly asserted its dominance over the old Parthian lands. In response to the threat that it posed to the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire, Emperor Valerian set out to conquer the lands of this Sasanian Empire. After a disastrous engagement against the Persian King Shapur I near Edessa, Valerian was captured and is held prisoner in the Persian capital of Ctesiphon.\n\nA caravan of gold and precious goods was dispatched towards Ctesiphon to ransom Valerian and ease the tension between the Romans and their Sasanian neighbors. The caravan, however, was waylaid and the ransom stolen. Parthian and Palmyran bandits still operate out of hidden enclaves in the Zagros Mountains. You are to restore order in this region, recover the ransom, and deliver it to Ctesiphon.\n\nCele:\n• Recapture the three tribute wagons (Artifacts) and deliver them to the palace (foot of the Cud) in Ctesiphon.\n• Destroy all Palmyran and Parthian Stables."

Use them to help supply your forces.\n3. Beware of Sassanid forces, for they will not hesitate to capture your tribute.\n4. Avoid conflict—do not let anyone, including your allies, near your tribute."
70932,"Your quick and effective action in Mesopotamia has restored much popular confidence in the Roman military. Unfortunately, the Persians were not swayed by your offer of ransom, and the former Emperor Valerian is doomed to live out his life as slave to Shapur I. All is not lost, however. Your exploits have succeeded in convincing the Palmyrans that Rome is still strong despite the dangerous Sasanian neighbor to the east. The Palmyrans will support you in future conflicts against the Sassanids."
70933,"Your failure to recover the ransom has led to the execution of Valerian at the hands of the Sassanids. The eastern portion of the Empire lies in turmoil while civil war rages back in Rome over the right to succeed him. The tribes of Germania have crossed the Rhine and Danube frontiers while the Romans continue to fight each other. Thanks to your incompetence, the Empire is in danger of collapse. Report to the Imperial court for duty as a footstool."
70934,"The collapse of the Parthian Empire began with the campaigns of the Roman emperor Trajan, under whom the Roman Empire reached its greatest territorial extent in the early second century CE. Over the next hundred years, the Parthian Empire was worn down by internal instability and military humiliation at the hands of expansionist Roman emperors. For a moment, it seemed that the Romans might have succeeded in emulating the achievements of Alexander.\n\nStarting in the early third century CE, that all changed, however. The Arsacid dynasty was overthrown by Ardashir I of the Dom of Sasan at Hormozdgan in 224 CE. The new Sasanian dynasty was considerably more efficient than the Parthians in virtually every sphere of governance, and its military systems were far superior as well. The greatest fear of many Romans had been realized—they now had a potent, functioning threat facing them from the East.\n\nThe rise of the Sasanian Empire coincided with a period of instability within the Roman Empire known as the Third Century Crisis. The Roman currency was devalued, sending the economy into a tailspin, the military structure decayed, and over twenty emperors ruled within a span of fifty years. On several occasions, eastern campaigns met with disaster. The Sassanid Shapur I (240-272 CE) defeated three Roman emperors while greatly expanding the dominion of the Sasanian Empire. The Roman Emperor Valerian was captured near Edessa and ended his life as a slave, by some accounts being forced to serve as Shapur’s personal footstool and later being stuffed like a taxidermy specimen.\n\nSimultaneously, Germanic incursions across the Rhine and Danube frontiers increased. By 260 CE the empire was in such a volatile condition that portions of it split off, forming the short-lived Palmyrene and Gallic Empires. These states were nominally aligned to Rome, but tended to act predominantly out of their own interests. The Roman Empire barely survived this turmoil but would eventually recover under the effective governance of a series of strong emperors."

70940,"Thrace, 271 CE\n\nAs the Third Century Crisis drags on, the weaknesses in the overextended Roman Empire become more and more evident. The Alemanni confederation threatens the northern portion of Italia, and the Getae have invaded the Balkans. The Palmyrans, once loyal allies, have rebelled under the leadership of Septimia Zenobia and seized most of our eastern provinces. Defend the northern frontiers of the empire, Emperor Aurelian, while destroying the Palmyrans and restoring the eastern provinces to Roman control.\n\nCele:\n• Defeat the Palmyrans.\n• None of your Centrum miasta may be destroyed."
70941,"1. Each of your Centrum miasta could come under attack at any time. Be prepared to establish a strong defense around each one.\n2. Targeting the weak link in the enemy forces will slow their attacks considerably.\n3. You cannot construct new Centrum miasta. Protect the ones that you already have.\n4. It is not necessary to destroy all your enemies to win. Defeating Queen Zenobia is enough."
70942,"Success! Due to your martial and military prowess as an emperor, you have restored Imperial control in the provinces and saved the Empire from ruin. The Senate and the people hail your complete victory over the Palmyrans, Alemanni, and Getae. Although Germanic incursions may continue from time to time, the security of the frontiers has been improved considerably. Prepare for your triumph in the city of Rome, where you will present the defeated Zenobia and parade her through the streets!"
70943,"Due to your failure to maintain the borders of the Empire, it is evident that all is beyond repair. The eastern provinces are certainly lost. You have allowed Rome to be defeated by Palmyra, a city of merchants, not warriors! Those are German tribesmen beating on the doors of Rome right now, not olive oil salesmen."
70944,"In the chaos following the defeat and capture of Emperor Valerian by the Sasanian Shapur I in 260 CE, many of the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire fell under the sphere of influence of the city of Palmyra in modern-day Syria. Simultaneously, the Rhine and Danube frontiers were threatened by incursions from the Alemanni (\"all men\"—a confederation of numerous Germanic tribes) and the Getae (a group of Thracian and Dacian people), respectively.\n\nSeptimia Zenobia was the wife of Odaenathus, Lord of Palmyra. She accompanied and assisted her husband on his campaigns. After a successful campaign in Asia Minor against the invading Heruli, Odaenathus was assassinated in 266 CE and was succeeded by his son, Vaballathus. The real power in Palmyra, however, was Queen (and self-proclaimed Empress) Zenobia. In the early 270s CE, she led an open rebellion against the Roman Emperor Aurelian, proclaiming the independent Palmyrene Empire.\n\nAurelian acted decisively, however. After defeating incursions by the Alemanni and the Getae and earning the title Gothicus Maximus (due to a popular confusion of the Getae with the Goths), he marched an army through the rebel provinces. Most cities surrendered without a fight, but those that resisted were leveled and their populations put to the sword. By 273 CE, the eastern provinces had been restored to Imperial control. The following year, Aurelian would succeed in reconquering the Gallic Empire, another rebel splinter state, and reunifying the Empire. Unfortunately, he was assassinated in 275 CE by the Praetorian Guard.\n\nThe legacy of Aurelian and other so-called \"barracks emperors\" was immense. An able administrator and reformer, Aurelian likely would have succeeded in restoring the Empire to pre-Third Century Crisis levels of stability if not for his untimely death. However, a decade later, the Empire was under the rule of Diocletian, one of the most able emperors in Roman history, who reorganized the Empire into a tetrarchy (four regions controlled by four different leaders) in 293 CE. His successful reforms were continued by the Emperor Constantine, who was best known for his conversion to Christianity and the construction of a new imperial capital at Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul)."

70950,"Pannonia, 373 CE\n\nA new and more fearsome group of barbarians, the Huns, have been moving west from Central Asia for the past several decades. They are skilled horsemen and are rumored to be nigh invincible! Germanic and Alanic tribes alike flee before them, flooding towards the frontiers of the Empire. The upcoming invasion will be the ultimate test of the strength of the Empire. If you cannot parry their incursions, Rome will be sacked, and the empire overrun!\n\nCele:\n• Build up and destroy the Huns (red).\n• Defend the Empire from Vandal, Gothic, and Alanic incursions."
70951,"1. This scenario plays like a Igrzyska Âmierci. You must quickly muster a large force with which to combat the Huns.\n2. Your allies are not very trustworthy and may change their allegiance if they suspect that the other side is winning.\n3. The Huns rely heavily on Konny îuczniks. Use Scythe Rydwans and Balistae to deal with them."
70952,"Your people breathe a sigh of relief as your armies emerge victorious from the bloody conflict with these formidable invaders. The barbarians that were not killed or captured have fled far from your borders or have been incorporated into your armies as auxiliary forces. One day, they may eventually return, but, despite numerous apocalyptic predictions, the Roman Empire is secure for the time being. You can now concentrate on planning your campaign against Persia and expanding the borders of the Empire to new heights. Hail Caesar!"
70953,"Your ineptitude has caused the downfall of the Roman Empire, bringing an end to a thousand years of glorious history. Germanic marauders rampage across the provinces, pillaging and looting as they go, while Hunnic horsemen build mountains of human skulls and use fleeing Roman citizens for archery target practice. Get your best sandals on and run! "
70954,"By the mid-4th century CE, the Roman Empire had recovered at least partially from the disastrous Third Century Crisis, and its military had seen several necessary reforms that rendered it more able to resist enemy incursions. The vastness of the frontiers remained a problem, however, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to contend with both the Germanic threats to the north and the Sassanid Persian threat to the east. Social concerns, succession crises, and the ensuing civil wars only further complicated things.\n\nThe incursion of the Huns into Europe tipped the balance of power against the Roman defense system. The Huns were one of the first groups of Turkic nomads to migrate into the region, and were extremely skilled horsemen and horse archers. In 373 CE, they defeated the Alans at the Tanais river, subduing them and driving westward. Three years later, they had inflicted a widespread slaughter on the Gothic tribes living north of the Black Sea, forcing them to flee west and seek asylum within the Roman Empire.\n\nFaced with the incredible opportunity to peacefully incorporate the militarily-adept Goths as a subject people, Emperor Valens (or, perhaps, his officials) committed a series of grave errors. Hostilities broke out, culminating in the Battle (disaster) of Adrianople in 378 CE, where the Goths wiped out most of the military strength of the eastern half of the Empire. The Romans watched helplessly as they pillaged Greece and the Balkans before moving west towards Rome, which they would sack in 410 CE.\n\nThe Huns tended to attack in generational waves. Around 405 CE, they launched another invasion, forcing groups such as the Vandals, Goths, Suebi, and Alans into the Western Empire, while simultaneously pillaging Thrace. The above incursions would cost Rome some of its most valuable provinces. The Hunnic threat intensified under the rule of Attila (r. 434-453), who commanded an immense confederation of Germanic, Turkic, and Alanic groups. Attila first mercilessly attacked the Eastern Empire, forcing them to abort a military endeavor to recapture North Africa from the Vandals, before swinging west into Gaul in 451 CE.\n\nThis campaign pitted the deadly Hunnic confederation against the forces of Flavius Aetius, a Roman commander who had grown up among the Huns and had managed to negotiate a loose alliance with several other \"barbarian\" tribes. They clashed at the Catalaunian Fields, a bloodbath that proved largely inconclusive. The Huns lost the battle from a strategic standpoint, but returned the following year to pillage Northern Italy. The Roman alliance fragmented, and Aetius, the last great Roman general, would be slain in cold blood by Emperor Valentinian III, who was jealous of his success. (Friends of Aetius would later murder Valentinian in an act of retribution.)\n\nApproaching the gates of Rome, Attila was met by Pope Leo I, who persuaded him to turn away from the city (perhaps in the context of the famine and plague that was rampant in the region at the time). Attila returned home in glory, but died in a drunken stupor after the feast in honor of his wedding to the Germanic princess Ildico, perhaps from a nasal hemorrhage that choked him with his own blood. The Hunnic confederation would not long survive his death, but the Hunnic and Germanic invasions had done their damage. The military strength of the Western Roman Empire, which boasted a standing army of 200,000 nearly five decades earlier, had been nearly entirely erased, and the Western Empire collapsed in 476 CE."

71110,"The Alps, 218 BCE\n\nHannibal of Carthage, your plan to invade Italy by crossing the Alps is cunning, brilliant, and fraught with risk.

71112,"Your crossing of the Alps was a masterstroke in the annals of history. All of Carthage applauds you and your army. With Italy before you, Rome will feel your vengeance!"
71113,"Your failure in the Alps has doomed Carthage. Only a successful invasion of Italy would have slowed the Roman advance. Now, Roman legions march into Hispania, and it will only be a matter of time before they reach Carthage itself. You were a fool to think elephants could cross the Alps, and your punishment is to be slowly crushed to death under the feet of one of your pachyderms."
71114,"Following Carthage's defeat in the First Punic War (264 – 241 BCE), the North African power lost naval supremacy in the Central Mediterranean to the Romans. When hostilities between Rome and Carthage resumed in 218 BCE, Carthage was unable to challenge Roman naval power, preventing a Carthaginian seaborne invasion of Italy. A twenty-nine-year-old Carthaginian general based in Hispania, however, had a solution to Carthage's strategic challenge.\n\nIn the spring of 218 BCE, Hannibal Barca departed Carthago Nova in eastern Hispania with an army of reportedly 40,000 infantry and 12,000 horsemen, as well as his famous elephants. Marching north, he crossed the Pyrenees, subduing mountain tribes, and then continued through southern Gaul, fighting hostile chiefs, allying with others, and bolstering his force with mercenaries. The Romans, alarmed by Hannibal's movements, sent an army under Publius Cornelius Scipio, father of Hannibal's later foil, to intercept him, but Hannibal evaded this Roman force. Reaching the Alps and with the winter approaching, Hannibal led his army—primarily composed of North Africans and Iberians unaccustomed to the extreme cold and the high altitudes—through the dangerous mountains. They suffered heavy casualties from raids by Celtic tribes, as well as from disease and exposure to the extreme elements. Many men lost their footing and plunged to their deaths in the high mountain passes. Hannibal exhorted his men onward, and finally they reached the Po Valley of Northern Italy. Hannibal and his warriors spent the next fifteen years in Italy, defeating the Romans in multiple engagements, but ultimately would fail to take their ultimate prize: the city of Rome."

71120,"Thessaly, 171 BCE\n\nKing Perseus of Macedon, your spies in Rome have brought word that your rival, the King of Pergamon, traveled from his lands in western Anatolia to give a speech to the Roman Senate.

The Romans are sending more aid to their Greek allies and the Kingdom of Pergamon. You had better start learning Latin. Here is your first lesson: \"Puer ego sum. Hoc ludum est difficile.\""
71124,"By the time Perseus ascended the throne of Macedon in 179 BCE, Rome had become a major power broker in Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. The defeat of Perseus' father, Philip V, in the Second Macedonian War (200 – 197 BCE) had forced Macedon to relinquish its possessions in southern Greece, Thrace, and Asia Minor. With this weakening of Macedonian power and influence, Rome forged alliances with Greek cities, including Pergamon, a Greek kingdom on the Ionian coast.\n\nUpon his ascension, Perseus immediately pursued an anti-Roman policy, drumming up sentiment against Rome and forming alliances against the growing Republic. Perseus was not simply motivated by ambition but also by a personal vendetta against Rome. Although Philip V had officially become a Roman ally after his defeat, the Romans continued to interfere in Macedonian politics. At their urging, Philip even named his son, Demetrius—a man with pro-Roman attitudes—his successor over Perseus, his eldest son. This led to infighting within the Macedonian royalty, forcing Philip to reluctantly execute Demetrius for treason in 180 BCE. This outcome of Roman meddling may have weighed heavily on Perseus when he ascended the throne a year later.\n\nTensions escalated when the Anatolian kingdom of Bithynia pursued an alliance with Perseus. Bithynia was in conflict with Pergamon. Eumenes II, King of Pergamon, traveled to Rome and gave an inflammatory speech to the Roman Senate, urging the Senate to act against Perseus, whom he claimed would jeopardize Roman interests in Greece and the East. Various Greek cities were alarmed by Eumenes' actions, fearing that Roman intervention would diminish their autonomy and make them subject to Rome. Their protests only galvanized the growing pro-interventionist and anti-Macedonian sentiments in Rome. When Eumenes passed through the city of Delphi on his return to Pergamon, he was set upon by assassins sent by Perseus, but survived the attempt. As war broke out, kingdoms and cities in Greece, Thrace, and Anatolia threw their lot to Dowolnie Perseus or the Romans.\n\nAlthough the Macedonians had some early successes, such as the Battle of Callinicus (171 BCE), the Roman military ultimately triumphed. At the Battle of Pydna in 168 BCE, the Roman consul Aemilius Paullus decisively defeated Perseus and ended Macedonian power. Perseus fled the battle, but later surrendered to Paullus. Perseus was paraded in Rome in chains and imprisoned. Roman retribution was harsh: Roman officials deported and enslaved large numbers of Macedonians who had expressed anti-Roman sentiments and parceled out their lands to Roman colonists. The kingdom of Macedon was dissolved and replaced with four republics subservient to Rome."

71134,"Although Roman citizens enjoyed many rights during the Republic, the same could not be said of Rome's slaves, who numbered 35-40% of Italy's population. Rome's wars of expansion contributed to the number of slaves, with ancient sources citing the capture and sale of thousands of men, women, and children with every conquest. Because slaves often retained skills from their previous lives, they worked a variety of occupations; from household servants, farmhands, and miners, to even accountants and physicians. Nevertheless, the lives of most Roman slaves were nasty, brutish, and short, and many slaves made efforts to escape. If caught, fugitive slaves would be killed or branded on the forehead with letters signifying their status as fugitives. Slave collars have survived with inscriptions promising rewards for the return of the slave if he or she ran away.\n\nGladiators were only a small percentage of Rome's slave population, but they captured the Roman imagination. Gladiators fought other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals for the entertainment of audiences throughout the Republic and the Empire. The fact that gladiators were trained warriors, often prisoners of war, with access to weapons made them potentially dangerous.\n\nLittle is known of Spartacus' life before he became a leader in the slave uprising which would become known as the Third Servile War (73 – 71 BCE). According to one writer, Spartacus was a Thracian who served as an auxiliary with the Roman army, but had been sold as a gladiator as a punishment for desertion. In 73 BCE, Spartacus escaped with 70 other gladiators from a gladiatorial training school at Capua, in Southern Italy. They recruited other slaves from the area and established a base at Mount Vesuvius. The Romans sent troops to besiege the slaves but Spartacus and his men twice defeated them, recovering weapons from the Romans. These victories encouraged more slaves to revolt until Spartacus' rebellion numbered 70,000.\n\nWith so many slaves in open revolt, the Roman authorities acted quickly, dispatching legions to crush the uprising. Surprisingly, Spartacus and his army triumphed again. Then, in a decision still debated by historians, Spartacus, rather than continuing north to freedom in Gaul, turned his army south, plundering through Italy.\n\nThe Senate, faced with a seemingly unstoppable rebellion, assigned Marcus Licinius Crassus to defeat Spartacus. Crassus was famously the wealthiest man in Rome and would be a future Triumvir with Pompey and Caesar. He was also known for his brutal discipline. The Roman historian Appian writes that after a unit of Crassus' men were defeated by the slaves, he had the unit decimated (every tenth man killed) for cowardice. This treatment demonstrated to the legions that the fate for displeasing their commander would be worse than anything their enemies could do to them.\n\nAt the Battle of the Silarus River (71 BCE), Crassus decisively defeated Spartacus and ended the rebellion. Roman writers stated that Spartacus died on the battlefield, but his body was never recovered. Some 6,000 slaves were captured and crucified on a 120-mile-long stretch of the Appian Way, the road from Rome to Capua."

71140,"Syria and Mesopotamia, 262 CE\n\nThe Emperor Valerian lies captive in a Persian dungeon following his defeat at Edessa. His son and successor, Gallienus, faces revolts in Egypt and Gaul. The Empire is in turmoil, and the Persian horde continues its westward march, nearing your client kingdom of Palmyra. The emperor is entrusting you, Odaenathus, King of Palmyra, to serve Rome by defeating the Persian host. Drive the Persians from Syria and take our war to their cities and you will be acclaimed Imperator Orientis, Commander of the East.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Persians."
71141,"1. Supplies are very limited in the dry desert, so protect your remote camps at all costs.\n2. A defensive strategy is necessary until you have built enough troops for a successful offense."
71142,"Word of your success has reached the Emperor Gallienus. He is most pleased with his Palmyran allies and confers great titles upon you. Enjoy the spoils of victory, Odaenathus, and the company of your young sons and beautiful wife Zenobia, as the triumphs of ambitious men like yourself are often fleeting."
71143,"Your failure to drive the Persians back has added to Rome's frontier problems. Most of the eastern part of the empire is now open to further Persian raids and conquest. Though your title as Imperator Orientis has been revoked, take heart; the emperor has bestowed a new title upon you, Nausius Maximus."
71144,"In 260 CE, the Persian Shahanshah (King of Kings) Shapur I raided Roman territory in Syria and northern Mesopotamia. The emperor, Valerian, met the Persian army near Edessa but suffered one of the most significant defeats in Roman history. When the defeated emperor attempted to negotiate with Shapur, he was captured. Beset by revolts elsewhere in the Empire, Rome turned to a Romanized Arab king named Odaenathus, ruler of a small but powerful client kingdom called Palmyra, to avenge the defeat.\n\nIn the 3rd century CE, Palmyra was a wealthy Syrian city astride a prominent caravan route. Although attached to the Roman province of Syria, Palmyra enjoyed autonomy and had, under Odaenathus, been elevated to the status of a kingdom. Though the sources around Odaenathus' rise are ambiguous, his military successes against Persia earned him the trust of the Romans and significant power and influence. Odaenathus followed Valerian's defeat with stunning offensive victories in Persian territory, even twice besieging the Persian capital at Ctesiphon.\n\nIn 267 CE, Odaenathus was forced to abandon his Mesopotamian campaign due to an influx of Heruli tribesmen raiding the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. Soon after, the Palmyran king was assassinated under unusual circumstances. The kingship then passed to Odaenathus' young son, with the dead king's widow, Zenobia, serving as regent."

71210,"Southern Sicily, 262 BCE\n\nYour command in Sicily has been uneventful, save for a roving band of rebellious mercenaries who pillaged much of the island and angered the tyrant of Syracuse. Carthage's ruling council sees this as an opportunity to expand Carthage's influence, but a strange Italian backwater town has intervened in these affairs. The soldiers from this town call themselves Romans and they march on your positions. By the grace of Ba'al Hammon, King of the Gods, deal with these Roman upstarts.\n\nCele:\n• Destroy both Roman Government Centers.\n• Do not allow your Centrum rzçdowe to be destroyed."
71211,"1. It is not necessary to destroy the Romans entirely. The Government Centers alone should be your target.\n2. Friendly Numidian Jeèdziec will aid you if you can reach them in the west."
71212,"Though you defeated them, these Romans have impressed you with their fighting skill and tenacity. They are respectable fighters on dry land, but, as Sicily is an island, only naval mastery can assure victory. Fortunately, Carthage still dominates the sea."
71213,"Your failure to defeat these interlopers from a minor backwater town has lost the key island of Sicily to our enemies. Our colonies and trade routes to the West are now in great danger. Report to fleet headquarters for duty as a rowing bench."
71214,"Founded in 814 BCE by settlers from the Phoenician city of Tyre, Carthage was a major maritime power in the Mediterranean. Based on the coast of modern-day Tunisia, Carthage's power and influence extended along the North African coast, the Iberian Peninsula, Sicily, and the islands of the Western Mediterranean. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, Carthage and the rising power of Rome would become embroiled in three wars, known to the Romans as the Punic Wars, for the Latin word for Phoenician.\n\nThe First War (264 – 241 BCE) began when a group of Italian mercenaries called the Mamertines, or Sons of Mars, occupied the city of Messana on the northeast tip of Sicily. They pillaged the surrounding countryside, putting them in conflict with Hiero II, king of the Greek Sicilian city of Syracuse. The Mamertines were defeated in battle by the Syracusans but appealed to both the Romans and Carthaginians for assistance. Carthage dispatched a garrison to Messana, but the mercenaries further petitioned Rome. The historian Polybius writes that the Romans weighed aiding unlawful mercenaries against the dangerous prospect of allowing Carthage to increase her power in Sicily, particularly so close to Italy. A deadlocked Senate put the matter to popular assembly, where it was decided to aid the Mamertines.\n\nLanding at Messana in 264 BCE, the Romans marched on Syracuse. The city made peace with Rome and became a critical ally. The presence of a friendly power on the island meant that Roman troops could be supplied so far from Rome without relying on sea-based provisioning, which would have been a challenge for Rome given Carthage's naval superiority.\n\nIn 262 BCE, the first large-scale battle was fought between Rome and Carthage. The Roman troops were citizen soldiers of a martial civic culture and hardened by the wars of expansion in Italy and the war against Pyrrhus of Epirus. In contrast, Carthage was a mercantile republic which relied heavily on mercenaries, usually recruited from North Africa, Iberia, and Gaul. At the city of Agrigentum in Southern Sicily, the Romans besieged the Carthaginians. After more than six months of siege and with starvation affecting both sides, the two armies met in battle outside the city walls. Although the Romans ended up taking Agrigentum, the Carthaginian army was able to escape."

71220,"Northeast Sicily, 260 BCE\n\nThe Romans have not ceased their meddling. More disturbingly, they have studied one of your wrecked warships and are using it as a model to build an entire fleet! These ships will allow them to protect their supply lines from Italy, keeping their armies in Sicily equipped and reinforced. The first of these new vessels are nearing your positions off the coast of Mylae. To demonstrate the futility of challenging Carthage at sea, capture the Roman supply carts and bring them back to your base. May Ba'al Hammon guide you!\n\nCele:\n• Bring two War Chests containing Roman supplies to the blue flagged area on your island.\n• Alternatively, kill your opponents."
71221,"1. Use towers and walls along the coastline to defend against the Roman navy while you construct your own navy.\n2. Explore the map to find additional resources."
71222,"Your victory has reminded the Romans that Carthage rules the waves. Despite their defeat, however, the Romans remain undaunted and have continued to work on building their fleet. With the speed with which they have already replaced their losses, you worry that even Carthaginian shores will soon be threatened."
71223,"The failure of the Carthaginian forces under your command has undone our recent victories over Rome. The people of Sicily now send tribute to Rome, not Carthage. The captain of your ship has been ordered to throw you overboard so that you can swim home through shark-infested waters to receive new orders."
71224,"Although the Roman supply lines in Sicily benefited from the alliance with Syracuse, Rome could not effectively provide reinforcements from Italy, nor take the war to Carthage, without first challenging Carthaginian sea power. Polybius relates that the Romans found a wrecked Carthaginian quinquereme, a heavy warship with five rows of oars, compared to a trireme with only three, and used it as a model to rapidly build an entire fleet.\n\nThe Romans also innovated with the corvus, Latin for crow, a boarding bridge affixed to Roman ships which allowed them to board and capture enemy vessels. This was a critical invention for the Romans who, while superior at melee combat, were less effective at the ranged combat and ramming tactics generally used by naval powers like Carthage. The emphasis on boarding allowed Rome to leverage her army's strengths by effectively turning sea battles into land battles on the decks of ships. It also provided the Romans with captured Carthaginian vessels to add to their growing navy.\n\nOff the coast of Mylae in Northeast Sicily, Rome and Carthage fought their first major naval battle in 260 BCE. The use of the corvus won the battle for Rome, helping the Romans seize 50 Carthaginian ships, including the Carthaginian flagship. Rather than pursue the retreating Carthaginians, the Roman commander sailed to Sicily to take command of his land troops and relieve the siege of the city of Segesta. This allowed Carthage's navy to escape to fight later battles."

71230,"Carthaginian Coast, 255 BCE\n\nFrustrated by your victories in Sicily, the Romans have sent the general Regulus to attack our homeland in Africa. His army now threatens the city of Carthage while the Roman navy approaches to blockade our ports. You must defend Carthage from these attacks and turn the tides of the battle. May Ba'al Hammon protect us and grant us victory!\n\nCele:\n• Destroy the Roman Cud.\n• Build your own Cud in the center of Carthage, inside the blue flags."
71231,"1. The mercenary force of the Spartan soldier of fortune, Xanthippus, is available for hire if you can find it.\n2. It is not necessary to destroy the Roman shipyards, only to prevent their navy from destroying your Cud.\n3. Use some of Carthage's best military units, including Long Szermierze, Galera ogniowas, and War Elephants."
71232,"You have snatched victory from near defeat! The Roman army has been crushed and Regulus sits in chains in your tent. Word has come that the fleeing survivors of the Roman fleet were caught in a storm and found their graves at the bottom of the sea. While your stunning victory has saved Carthage, you know that the Romans will never surrender. You fear that you have only delayed their eventual triumph."
71233,"Your failure to defeat the Roman army has forced us to accept their peace terms, which are harsh. Take note of the treaty clause requiring that you serve out your years in a Roman stone quarry."
71234,"The war in Sicily increasingly became an endeavor of one lengthy siege after another. Seeking a swifter victory, the Romans planned a daring invasion of the North African coast to take the war to the Carthaginian homelands.\n\nAt the Battle of Cape Ecnomus (256 BCE), off the southern coast of Sicily, the Romans defeated Carthage in one of the ancient world's largest naval battles. Over 600 vessels participated in the engagement, which demonstrated that Rome could now challenge Carthage at sea on an equal footing. The victory allowed the Roman army, under the command of Marcus Atilius Regulus, to land in Africa.\n\nAt the Battle of Adys (255 BCE), Regulus defeated the Carthaginians, plundering the countryside and marching on Carthage. This weakening of the North African power incited the Numidians, a Berber people and sometime allies of Carthage, to revolt. Refugees from the pillaged countryside fled to the capital, causing an outbreak of disease and hunger.\n\nFortunately for Carthage, a Spartan mercenary general named Xanthippus appeared. The Spartan recognized that Carthage's cavalry and elephants, the backbone of its army, would fight best on open ground, allowing them to maneuver. Previously, Carthaginian generals had sought to fight the Romans in sieges and on rough terrain, where the tough Roman infantry held the advantage.\n\nThese changes were crucial to Carthaginian success at the Battle of Tunis, also known as the Battle of Bagradas, in 255 BCE. Battered by an elephant charge, flanked by the Carthaginian cavalry, and unable to defeat the Carthaginian phalanx in the center, the Romans were routed by a final cavalry charge. Regulus was captured and, according to Roman legends, was released on parole to negotiate a peace. In Rome, he urged the Senate to refuse the peace proposal and, fulfilling the terms of his parole, was said to have returned to Carthage to be tortured to death. The defeat of the Romans at Tunis was followed by the sinking of the Roman fleet in a storm, ending Rome's attempts at invading Africa during the war. The First Punic War would drag on for another fourteen years culminating in Carthage's defeat at the Battle of the Aegates in 241 BCE.\n\nAs for Xanthippus, his final fate is uncertain. Diodorus of Sicily writes that after the Battle of Tunis, the Spartan general saved the city of Lilybaeum in Sicily from a Roman siege. Leaders in the city were jealous of their savior's success and betrayed him by giving him a leaky ship for his voyage home."
